DETERMINATION OF SULPHUR COMPOUNDS INDRY LIME-SULPHUR By Carleton Parker Jones Assistant Research Professor of Chemistry, Massachusetts A gricultural Experiment Station INTRODUCTION Lime-sulphur products and analogous substances, known as polysul-phids, have of recent years come into prominence because of their value asinsecticides and fungicides. Large quantities, especially of the lime-sulphur compound, are now manufactured. Correct and simple methodsare needed for the estimation of the principal constituents, both as a safe-guard to the producer and as a help to the entomologist and plant patholo-gist.

How did he do it?— This discovery of the nature of lightning was one of the most important ever made in science, and yet, Dr. Franklin made it simply by flying a kite in a thunder-shower (Fig. 82). He made his kite of silk instead of paper, and sent it up with a hempen cord ending in a piece of silk cord, by which the kite was held. It is said that he fastened a doorkey to the lower end of the hempen cord, and that after his kite had been for some time sailing among the clouds he touched the key with his knuckle and drew a spark of electricity from it. The electricity in the cloud entered the kite, and came down the hempen string to the key, but could not go any farther because the silk cord was not a conductor. When the doctor presented his hand the electricity in the key leaped into his knuckle. page 159 (Fig. 82) of Natural Philosophy for Common and High Schools (1881) An engraving of Benjamin Franklin 's kite experiment, from page 159 (Fig. 82) of Natural Philosophy for Common and High Schools (1881) by Le Roy C.

Key points from that compendium: The oblique fissure of the right lung goes from the intercostal space 4 to 6 The horizontal fissure goes along the 4th rib (the original image from Gray has this line almost at the 5th rib, but this is not labeled in image, as other lung images seem to support the upper level) The cardia of the stomach is at the level of the 10th rib The fundus of the stomach is in the 5th intercostal space, slightly below the apex of the heart Pylorus is usually at the L1 (the transpyloric plane) The transpyloric plane is at the level of: lumbar vertebra 1 the pancreatic body the origins of the superior mesenteric artery from the aorta and portal vein the left and right colic flexure hilum of the kidney on the left upper pole of the kidney on the right duodenojejunal flexure McBurney's point is located one third of a line from the anterior superior iliac spine and the navel The upper rim of the liver is in the 5th intercostal space The left lobe of the liver is to the left of the midline The lower limit of the liver at the midline is approximately 3 cm below processus xiphoideus The spleen is projected against the 9th and 10th rib on the backside The left kidney is approximately at the vertebral level T12 to L3, and the right one slightly lower.

    "detailedDescription": "Illustration of Davy Jones sitting on his locker, wearing a pirate captain's uniform, while viewing a 1789 chart of Ferrol Harbor , Spain, belonging to HMS Howe . The ship had run aground at the mouth of the harbor on 2 November 1892, allegedly after using a poorly prepared naval chart to navigate its waters. A Royal Navy court-martial opened an inquiry into the conduct of Vice Admiral Henry Fairfax , who was charged with negligence for ordering a hazardous course when the ship entered harbor. On 7 January 1893 the court found that the charge against Fairfax was not proven. \" Davy Jones' Locker \" is an idiom for the bottom of the sea: the state of death among drowned sailors. It is used as a euphemism for death at sea (to be \"sent to Davy Jones's Locker\"), whereas the name Davy Jones is a nickname for what would be the devil, saint, or god of the seas. The origins of the name are unclear and many theories have been put forth, including incompetent sailors, a pub owner who kidnapped sailors, or that Davy Jones is another name for the devil—as in \"Devil Jonah\".

Daddy Neptune loves me not. Plumped by storm or by shot, my Locker held a lot in the days gone by, But 'tis daily growing fuller.

Davy Jones is well content with that tribute ye have sent, with the millions ye have spent just to glut his gorge; He had seldom such a fill in the days of wood—and skill—constant sea-fights, or the spill of the Royal George . Good old false last-century Chart! Though the conning may be smart, and the steersman play his part, Palinurus -like, Whilst they trust to your vain vellum, which is almost sure to sell 'em, even Davy Jones can tell 'em, they may sink or strike. Hooray, King Death, hooray! Who says we've had our day! Pass the rum and let's be gay.

    "detailedDescription": "An absolutely stunning and monumental double hemisphere wall map of the world by Samuel Dunn dating to 1794. This extraordinary map is so large and so rich in detail that it is exceptionally challenging to do it full justice in either photographic or textual descriptions. Covers the entire world in a double hemisphere projection. The primary map is surrounded on all sides but detailed scientific calculations and descriptions as well as northern and southern hemisphere star charts, a map of the Moon, a Latitude and Longitude Analemma chart, a map of the Solar System, a Mercator projection of the world, an Analemma projection, a seasonal chart, a universal scale chart, and numerous smaller diagrams depicting planets and mathematical systems. All text is in English. We will start our survey of this map in North America, much of which was, even in 1794, largely unknown. This map follows shortly after the explorations of Captain Cook in the Arctic and Pacific Northwest, so the general outline of the continent is known. However, when this map was made, few inland expeditions had extended westward beyond the Mississippi. This map notes two separate speculative courses for the apocryphal River of the West, a northern route extending from Lake Winnipeg and a southern route passing south of Winnepeg through Pike's lake. The River of the West was hopeful dream of French and English explorers who were searching for a water passage through North America to the Pacific. In concept, should such a route be found, it would have become an important trade artery allowing the British and French, who's colonies dominated the eastern parts of North America, to compete with the Spanish for control of the lucrative Asia-Pacific trade. Little did these earlier speculative cartographers realize the bulk of the Rocky Mountains stood between them and their dreams! Slightly south of the Rivers of the West, we find the kingdom of Quivira, which is one of the lands associated with Spanish legends of the Seven Cities of Gold. In this area we can also find Drake's Harbor or Port de la Bodega and Albion. Drake's Harbor is where Sir Francis Drake supposedly landed during his circumnavigation of the globe in 1580. Drake wintered in this harbor and used the abundant resources of the region to repair his ships. He also claimed the lands for England dubbing them New Albion. Although the true location of Drake's port is unknown, most place it much further to the north. By situating it and consequently New Albion further to the south, Dunn is advocating a British rather than Spanish claim to this region. On the Eastern coast of North America we find a fledgling United States extending from Georgia to Maine. Dunn names Boston, New York, Charleston, Long Island, and Philadelphia, as well as the important smaller towns of Jamestown, Williamsburg and Edonton. South America exhibits a typically accurate coastline and limited knowledge of the interior beyond Peru and the populated coastlands. A few islands are noted off the coast, including the Galapagos, which are referred to as the Inchanted Islands. The Amazon is vague with many of its tributaries drawn in speculatively. Dunn and d'Anville have done away with the popular representation of Manoa or El Dorado in Guyana, but a vestigial Lake Parima is evident. Further south, the Laguna de los Xarayes, another apocryphal destination, is drawn at the northernmost terminus of the Paraguay River. The Xaraiés, meaning Masters of the River were an indigenous people occupying what are today parts of Brazil's Matte Grosso and the Pantanal. When Spanish and Portuguese explorers first navigated up the Paraguay River, as always in search of El Dorado, they encountered the vast Pantanal flood plain at the height of its annual inundation. Understandably misinterpreting the flood plain as a gigantic inland sea, they named it after the local inhabitants, the Xaraies.

According to a 2006 comment: \"The military branch of Hamas has a different flag, green with Shahada on it. Maybe that's why there is a confusion about the Hamas flag. One is white with Hamas emblem on it, and the military branch's flag is green with a shahada?

I saw this flag several times at Hamas demonstrations and at generic anti-Israel events in Palestine. Hamas emblem is here.\" (Santiago Tazón, 20 Dec 2001) While this flag has apparently been spotted in Hamas demonstrations since at least 2001, it cannot be identified as \"the flag of Hamas\". It has rather been carried by Hamas supporters as symbolizing Islam or Islamism, not as an emblem of Hamas as an organization. \"It would be wrong to name the flag as the Hamas flag. Such flags, with the Sha'ada in white on green or black, are used by other Islamic groups and are not unique to Hamas.

    "detailedDescription": "This is topographic map of Antarctica after removing the ice sheet and accounting for both isostatic rebound and sea level rise. Hence this map suggests what Antarctica may have looked like 35 million years ago, when the Earth was warm enough to prevent the formation of large-scale ice sheets in Antarctica. Isostatic rebound is the result of the weight of the ice sheet depressing the land under it. After the ice is removed, the land will rise over a period of thousands of years by an amount approximately 1/3 as high as the ice sheet that was removed (because rock is 3 times as dense as ice). Approximately half the uplift occurs during the first two thousand years. If the ice sheet is removed over more than a few thousand years, then it is possible that a majority of the uplift will occur before the ice sheet fully disappears. As indicated in the map, Antarctica consists of a large continental region (East Antarctica) and group of seas and smaller land regions (West Antarctica). Since the West Antarctic ice sheet is partially anchored below sea level, this region is less stable and more likely to be affected by global warming. Even so, it is likely that during the next century increased precipitation over Antarctica will offset melting. Even in the event of severe sustained warming, it would take many thousands of years for Eastern Antarctica to be fully deglaciated. http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:Antarctica_Without_Ice_Sheet_png This is topographic map of Antarctica after removing the ice sheet and accounting for both isostatic rebound and sea level rise.

    "detailedDescription": "The bloody massacre perpetrated in King Street Boston on March 5th 1770 by a party of the 29th Regt. According to the Library of Congress ( 1 ): A sensationalized portrayal of the skirmish, later to become known as the \"Boston Massacre,\" between British soldiers and citizens of Boston on March 5, 1770. On the right a group of seven uniformed soldiers, on the signal of an officer, fire into a crowd of civilians at left. Three of the latter lie bleeding on the ground. Two other casualties have been lifted by the crowd. In the foreground is a dog; in the background are a row of houses, the First Church, and the Town House.

Negro Estimate of Freedom!\" The bureau is pictured as a large domed building resembling the U.S. Capitol and is inscribed \"Freedom and No Work.\" Its columns and walls are labeled, \"Candy,\" \"Rum, Gin, Whiskey,\" \"Sugar Plums,\" \"Indolence,\" \"White Women,\" \"Apathy,\" \"White Sugar,\" \"Idleness,\" \"Fish Balls,\" \"Clams,\" \"Stews,\" and \"Pies.\" At right is a table giving figures for the funds appropriated by Congress to support the bureau and information on the inequity of the bounties received by black and white veterans of the Civil War.

    "detailedDescription": "Teddy bear early 1900s - Smithsonian Museum of Natural History - 2012-05-15 An original \"Teddy Bear\" from 1903, manufactured by Benjamin Michton, son of the founder of the Ideal Toy Co. This bear was owned by Theodore Roosevelt's grandson, Kermit. Michton gave the bear to him in December 1963. The Roosevelts donated it to the Smithsonian a month later. The name \"Teddy Bear\" comes from a political cartoon which made fun of President Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt went on a bear hunting trip in Mississippi in November 1902. A small black bear was cornered, clubbed, and tied to a tree. The hunters offered to let Roosevelt shoot it, but he refused -- saying it was unsportsmanlike. Roosevelt did ask that the bear be killed to end its suffering. On November 16, 1902, \"Washington Post\" political cartoonist Clifford Berryman drew an image of a disgusted Roosevelt refusing to kill a cute little bear. The cartoon was used to poke fun at Roosevelt's over-zealous hunting, fishing, and camping lifestyle. Morris Michtom, owner of a New York City toy store, saw the cartoon. He created a small stuffed bear cub toy, and sent it to Roosevelt. He asked the president's permission to use the name \"Teddy\", and Roosevelt consented. The toys were an immediate success. By 1906, ladies carried \"Teddy bears\" with them everywhere, children were photographed with them, and Roosevelt used one as a mascot in his re-election campaign. Michtom used his profits to found the Ideal Toy Co. Early teddy bears were made to look like real bears, with snouts and beady eyes.
