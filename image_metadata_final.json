How did he do it?\u2014 This discovery of the nature of lightning was one of the most important ever made in science, and yet, Dr. Franklin made it simply by flying a kite in a thunder-shower (Fig. 82). He made his kite of silk instead of paper, and sent it up with a hempen cord ending in a piece of silk cord, by which the kite was held. It is said that he fastened a doorkey to the lower end of the hempen cord, and that after his kite had been for some time sailing among the clouds he touched the key with his knuckle and drew a spark of electricity from it. The electricity in the cloud entered the kite, and came down the hempen string to the key, but could not go any farther because the silk cord was not a conductor. When the doctor presented his hand the electricity in the key leaped into his knuckle. page 159 (Fig. 82) of Natural Philosophy for Common and High Schools (1881) An engraving of Benjamin Franklin 's kite experiment, from page 159 (Fig. 82) of Natural Philosophy for Common and High Schools (1881) by Le Roy C.

Text Appearing Before Image: 34- ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND It was the Southern victory of Bull Run and theNorthern policy of blockade that finally and de-finitely changed the attitude of England and ofPunch. The victory gave hopes that the Con-federates might be successful in overturning, ahated and dreaded republic; the blockade arousedfears that the pocket of the British manufacturermight be damaged. All pretence of love for thenegro was swallowed up by these more potent andmore personal emotions. On November 2, 1801, in a cartoon and anaccompanying poem Punch, sought to put its com-mercial anxiety on an altruistic plane. Hereis the poem: KING COTTON BOUND; OR, THE NEWPROMETHEUS. Far across Atlantic waters Groans in chains a Giant King; Like to him, whom Oceans daughtersWail around in mournful ring. In the grand old Grecian strains Of Prometheus in his chains! Needs but Fancys pencil pliantBoth to paint till both agree; THE LONDON PUNCH 85 rUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI \u2014December 7, 1861. I my. Text Appearing After Image: LOOK OUT FOR SQUALLS. Jack Boll. YOU DO WHATS RIGHT. MY SON. OR ILL BLOW YOU OUT OF THE WATER. 36 ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND For King Cotton is a giant, As Prometheus claimed to be.Each gave blessings unto men,Each dishonour reaped again. From the gods to sons of clay If Prometheus brought the flame, Who King Cotton can gainsay.Should he equal honour claim ? Fire and life to millions giving. That, without him, had no living. And if they are one in blessing,So in suffering they are one; Both, their captive state confessing.Freeze in frost and scorch in sun: That, upon his mountain chain, This, upon his parching plain. Nor the wild birds self is wanting\u2014 Either giants torment sore;If Prometheus writhed, while panting Heart and lungs the vulture tore,So Columbias eagle fierce.Doth King Cottons vitals pierce.

Text Appearing Before Image: 34- ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND It was the Southern victory of Bull Run and theNorthern policy of blockade that finally and de-finitely changed the attitude of England and ofPunch. The victory gave hopes that the Con-federates might be successful in overturning, ahated and dreaded republic; the blockade arousedfears that the pocket of the British manufacturermight be damaged. All pretence of love for thenegro was swallowed up by these more potent andmore personal emotions. On November 2, 1801, in a cartoon and anaccompanying poem Punch, sought to put its com-mercial anxiety on an altruistic plane. Hereis the poem: KING COTTON BOUND; OR, THE NEWPROMETHEUS. Far across Atlantic waters Groans in chains a Giant King; Like to him, whom Oceans daughtersWail around in mournful ring. In the grand old Grecian strains Of Prometheus in his chains! Needs but Fancys pencil pliantBoth to paint till both agree; THE LONDON PUNCH 85 rUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI \u2014December 7, 1861. I my. Text Appearing After Image: LOOK OUT FOR SQUALLS. Jack Boll. YOU DO WHATS RIGHT. MY SON. OR ILL BLOW YOU OUT OF THE WATER. 36 ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND For King Cotton is a giant, As Prometheus claimed to be.Each gave blessings unto men,Each dishonour reaped again. From the gods to sons of clay If Prometheus brought the flame, Who King Cotton can gainsay.Should he equal honour claim ? Fire and life to millions giving. That, without him, had no living. And if they are one in blessing,So in suffering they are one; Both, their captive state confessing.Freeze in frost and scorch in sun: That, upon his mountain chain, This, upon his parching plain. Nor the wild birds self is wanting\u2014 Either giants torment sore;If Prometheus writhed, while panting Heart and lungs the vulture tore,So Columbias eagle fierce.Doth King Cottons vitals pierce.

It is used as a euphemism for death at sea (to be \"sent to Davy Jones's Locker\"), whereas the name Davy Jones is a nickname for what would be the devil, saint, or god of the seas.

    "detailedDescription": "An absolutely stunning and monumental double hemisphere wall map of the world by Samuel Dunn dating to 1794. This extraordinary map is so large and so rich in detail that it is exceptionally challenging to do it full justice in either photographic or textual descriptions. Covers the entire world in a double hemisphere projection. The primary map is surrounded on all sides but detailed scientific calculations and descriptions as well as northern and southern hemisphere star charts, a map of the Moon, a Latitude and Longitude Analemma chart, a map of the Solar System, a Mercator projection of the world, an Analemma projection, a seasonal chart, a universal scale chart, and numerous smaller diagrams depicting planets and mathematical systems. All text is in English. We will start our survey of this map in North America, much of which was, even in 1794, largely unknown. This map follows shortly after the explorations of Captain Cook in the Arctic and Pacific Northwest, so the general outline of the continent is known. However, when this map was made, few inland expeditions had extended westward beyond the Mississippi. This map notes two separate speculative courses for the apocryphal River of the West, a northern route extending from Lake Winnipeg and a southern route passing south of Winnepeg through Pike's lake. The River of the West was hopeful dream of French and English explorers who were searching for a water passage through North America to the Pacific. In concept, should such a route be found, it would have become an important trade artery allowing the British and French, who's colonies dominated the eastern parts of North America, to compete with the Spanish for control of the lucrative Asia-Pacific trade. Little did these earlier speculative cartographers realize the bulk of the Rocky Mountains stood between them and their dreams! Slightly south of the Rivers of the West, we find the kingdom of Quivira, which is one of the lands associated with Spanish legends of the Seven Cities of Gold. In this area we can also find Drake's Harbor or Port de la Bodega and Albion. Drake's Harbor is where Sir Francis Drake supposedly landed during his circumnavigation of the globe in 1580. Drake wintered in this harbor and used the abundant resources of the region to repair his ships. He also claimed the lands for England dubbing them New Albion. Although the true location of Drake's port is unknown, most place it much further to the north. By situating it and consequently New Albion further to the south, Dunn is advocating a British rather than Spanish claim to this region. On the Eastern coast of North America we find a fledgling United States extending from Georgia to Maine. Dunn names Boston, New York, Charleston, Long Island, and Philadelphia, as well as the important smaller towns of Jamestown, Williamsburg and Edonton. South America exhibits a typically accurate coastline and limited knowledge of the interior beyond Peru and the populated coastlands. A few islands are noted off the coast, including the Galapagos, which are referred to as the Inchanted Islands. The Amazon is vague with many of its tributaries drawn in speculatively. Dunn and d'Anville have done away with the popular representation of Manoa or El Dorado in Guyana, but a vestigial Lake Parima is evident. Further south, the Laguna de los Xarayes, another apocryphal destination, is drawn at the northernmost terminus of the Paraguay River. The Xarai\u00e9s, meaning Masters of the River were an indigenous people occupying what are today parts of Brazil's Matte Grosso and the Pantanal. When Spanish and Portuguese explorers first navigated up the Paraguay River, as always in search of El Dorado, they encountered the vast Pantanal flood plain at the height of its annual inundation. Understandably misinterpreting the flood plain as a gigantic inland sea, they named it after the local inhabitants, the Xaraies.
