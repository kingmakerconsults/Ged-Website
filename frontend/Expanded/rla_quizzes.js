      type: "multipleChoice",
      difficulty: "hard",
      passage: "The push for standardized testing in schools is often justified as a way to ensure accountability and measure performance. However, many educators argue that the focus on testing has narrowed the curriculum, forcing teachers to 'teach to the test.' Subjects like art, music, and social studies are often sidelined in favor of math and reading. This intense focus on a few subjects can stifle students' creativity and fail to prepare them for a world that requires diverse skills.",

      questionNumber: 10,
      type: "multipleChoice",
      difficulty: "hard",
      passage: "The reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park is a classic example of a trophic cascade. After the wolves were gone, the elk population exploded, leading to overgrazing of willow trees. The decline in willows, in turn, negatively affected the beaver population, which relied on them for food and dam-building. When wolves returned, they culled the elk herds, allowing the willows to recover. This led to a resurgence of beavers, whose dams created new habitats for fish and birds.",
      question: "Which piece of evidence from the text best supports the claim that the absence of wolves negatively affected beavers?",
      answerOptions: [
        { text: "The reintroduction of wolves is an example of a trophic cascade.", rationale: "This is the main concept, not the specific evidence about beavers.", isCorrect: false },
        { text: "Beaver dams created new habitats for fish and birds.", rationale: "This describes the positive effect of the beavers' return, not the negative effect of the wolves' absence.", isCorrect: false },
        { text: "The elk population exploded, leading to overgrazing of willows.", rationale: "This is the first step in the chain of events, but it doesn't directly connect to the beavers.", isCorrect: false },

      passage: "The 'slow food' movement, which began in Italy, is a direct response to the proliferation of fast food. It champions local culinary traditions, sustainable agriculture, and the enjoyment of meals in a communal setting. Proponents argue that this approach not only leads to better-tasting, more nutritious food but also supports local economies and preserves biodiversity. By encouraging consumers to think about the origin of their food, the movement seeks to create a more mindful and ethical food system.",
      question: "Which detail best supports the idea that the 'slow food' movement has a broader goal than just food quality?",
      answerOptions: [
        { text: "The movement began in Italy.", rationale: "This is a historical detail, not evidence of the movement's goals.", isCorrect: false },

      passage: "The architect I. M. Pei was renowned for his ability to blend modernism with a deep respect for cultural context. His design for the Louvre Pyramid, for example, was initially controversial. Critics argued that its sharp, geometric lines clashed with the museum's classical French Renaissance architecture. However, Pei meticulously chose glass that would reflect the color of the Paris sky and designed the structure to create a grand, light-filled entrance that improved visitor flow without detracting from the historic palace.",
      question: "Which piece of evidence from the text best supports the claim that Pei respected the cultural context of the Louvre?",
      answerOptions: [

      passage: "The bystander effect is a social psychological phenomenon in which individuals are less likely to offer help to a victim when other people are present. The greater the number of bystanders, the less likely it is that any one of them will help. This is attributed to a 'diffusion of responsibility,' where each person feels less personally responsible for acting because they assume someone else will. It is a powerful example of how the presence of others can influence individual behavior.",
