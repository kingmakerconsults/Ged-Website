However, a lesser-known but equally vital part of their operation was the breaking of the Lorenz cipher, a far more complex code used for high-level German communications. The decryption of Lorenz messages provided the Allies with crucial intelligence about German military strategy, including detailed plans for the defense of Normandy before the D-Day invasion. The ingenuity of the codebreakers who unraveled Lorenz, and the mechanical computer they built to do so, was a monumental achievement that remained classified for decades.",
