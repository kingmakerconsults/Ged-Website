- Topic: Selecting Evidence
- Recommendation: Reasoning Through Language Arts (RLA): keep direct fundamentals, remove filler, and ensure one clear skill target.
- Question: Which piece of evidence does the author use to counter the argument that technology is isolating?
- Passage: The argument that technology isolates us is overly simplistic. While it's true that people can spend too much time on their devices, technology also creates new avenues for connection. For instance, long-distance families can maintain close bonds through video calls. Online communities allow people with niche interests to find and connect with others who share their passions, regardless of geography. The problem is not the technology itself, but how we choose to use it.

- Question: Which detail from the passage best supports the claim that testing has 'narrowed the curriculum'?
- Passage: The push for standardized testing in schools is often justified as a way to ensure accountability and measure performance. However, many educators argue that the focus on testing has narrowed the curriculum, forcing teachers to 'teach to the test.' Subjects like art, music, and social studies are often sidelined in favor of math and reading. This intense focus on a few subjects can stifle students' creativity and fail to prepare them for a world that requires diverse skills.

- Question: Which piece of evidence from the text best supports the claim that the absence of wolves negatively affected beavers?
- Passage: The reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park is a classic example of a trophic cascade. After the wolves were gone, the elk population exploded, leading to overgrazing of willow trees. The decline in willows, in turn, negatively affected the beaver population, which relied on them for food and dam-building. When wolves returned, they culled the elk herds, allowing the willows to recover. This led to a resurgence of beavers, whose dams created new habitats for fish and birds.

- Question: Which detail best supports the idea that the 'slow food' movement has a broader goal than just food quality?
- Passage: The 'slow food' movement, which began in Italy, is a direct response to the proliferation of fast food. It champions local culinary traditions, sustainable agriculture, and the enjoyment of meals in a communal setting. Proponents argue that this approach not only leads to better-tasting, more nutritious food but also supports local economies and preserves biodiversity. By encouraging consumers to think about the origin of their food, the movement seeks to create a more mindful and ethical food system.

- Question: Which piece of evidence from the text best supports the claim that Pei respected the cultural context of the Louvre?
- Passage: The architect I. M. Pei was renowned for his ability to blend modernism with a deep respect for cultural context. His design for the Louvre Pyramid, for example, was initially controversial. Critics argued that its sharp, geometric lines clashed with the museum's classical French Renaissance architecture. However, Pei meticulously chose glass that would reflect the color of the Paris sky and designed the structure to create a grand, light-filled entrance that improved visitor flow without detracting from the historic palace.

- Question: Which piece of evidence does the author use to challenge the belief that homework is essential?
- Passage: The argument that homework is essential for academic success is not universally supported by research. While some studies show a modest correlation between homework and achievement in older students, the effect is negligible for elementary school students. Moreover, a heavy homework load can lead to burnout, stress, and a loss of interest in learning. A more effective approach may be to focus on engaging in-class activities and to assign homework that is purposeful and limited in volume.
