After the wolves were gone, the elk population exploded, leading to overgrazing of willow trees. The decline in willows, in turn, negatively affected the beaver population, which relied on them for food and dam-building. When wolves returned, they culled the elk herds, allowing the willows to recover. This led to a resurgence of beavers, whose dams created new habitats for fish and birds.",

His design for the Louvre Pyramid, for example, was initially controversial. Critics argued that its sharp, geometric lines clashed with the museum's classical French Renaissance architecture.
