## Untracked Files (assets without metadata entry)
- 261 image files have no entry in the current metadata JSON. The complete list is available in `reports/untracked_files.txt`.

## Coherence Check
- No filename-versus-description conflicts were detected. All expanded descriptions were aligned with the implied content of each filename and the available alt text/source context.

## Remediation Notes
- Expanded metadata descriptions and directives were written for all 28 records, including the eight entries whose image assets are presently missing from the repository. Descriptions rely on provided alt text and source documentation until the underlying media can be restored.
