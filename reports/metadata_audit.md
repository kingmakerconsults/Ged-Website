# Image Metadata Audit

## Inventory Cross-Reference
- Total metadata records reviewed: 1,427
- Total image files discovered in `frontend/Images`: 560

## Missing Files (metadata without matching asset)
- 867 metadata records reference image paths that do not exist in the repository and should be reviewed for archival or asset restoration.

## Untracked Files (assets without metadata entry)
- 0 image files are currently missing from `image_metadata_final.json`. All known assets are now represented (see `reports/untracked_files.txt`).

## Remediation Notes
- Added placeholder metadata for 258 previously untracked local assets, capturing file dimensions, SHA-1 hashes, and subject-specific descriptions for future refinement.
- Synchronized `backend/data/image_metadata_final.json` with the repository root copy so both sources now include the full inventory.
- Updated the untracked assets report to confirm coverage as of the latest audit.
