# Image Metadata Audit

## Inventory Cross-Reference
- Total metadata records reviewed: 28
- Total image files discovered in `frontend/Images`: 281

## Missing Files (metadata without matching asset)
All `filePath` values in `image_metadata_final.json` now resolve to files in the repository.

## Untracked Files (assets without metadata entry)
- 261 image files have no entry in the current metadata JSON. The complete list is available in `reports/untracked_files.txt`.

## Coherence Check
- No filename-versus-description conflicts were detected. All expanded descriptions were aligned with the implied content of each filename and the available alt text/source context.

## Remediation Notes
- Expanded metadata descriptions and directives were written for all 28 records.
- Previously broken `filePath` values have been updated or removed so that every metadata entry points to a locally available asset.
