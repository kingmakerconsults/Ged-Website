For decades, the idea that continents could drift was considered a radical, fringe theory. However, the accumulation of evidence—such as the discovery of mid-ocean ridges, the mapping of earthquake patterns, and the analysis of magnetic stripes on the ocean floor—eventually led to a paradigm shift in geology. This process demonstrates that scientific consensus is not static but evolves as new evidence emerges.",

Platforms like Kickstarter and GoFundMe allow individuals to solicit small amounts of money from a large number of people, a model known as micropatronage. This democratizes the funding process, giving creators a chance to bring their ideas to life without relying on a few wealthy investors or corporate sponsors. However, it also shifts the burden of marketing and promotion directly onto the creator, who must build and engage a community of supporters to succeed.",

However, a lesser-known but equally vital part of their operation was the breaking of the Lorenz cipher, a far more complex code used for high-level German communications. The decryption of Lorenz messages provided the Allies with crucial intelligence about German military strategy, including detailed plans for the defense of Normandy before the D-Day invasion. The ingenuity of the codebreakers who unraveled Lorenz, and the mechanical computer they built to do so, was a monumental achievement that remained classified for decades.",

The decryption of Lorenz messages provided the Allies with crucial intelligence about German military strategy, including detailed plans for the defense of Normandy before the D-Day invasion.

The synergistic effect of these stressors seems to weaken the bees' immune systems, making them more susceptible to collapse.
