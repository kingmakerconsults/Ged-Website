Purpose","questions":[{"questionNumber":1,"passage":"For over a century, human civilization has been powered predominantly by fossil fuels—coal, oil, and natural gas. While these energy sources fueled industrial revolutions and unprecedented economic growth, their use has come at a significant environmental cost, most notably climate change driven by greenhouse gas emissions. In response to this mounting crisis, a global energy transition is underway, shifting focus toward renewable sources. These sources, which include solar, wind, hydropower, and geothermal energy, are naturally replenished and produce minimal to no carbon emissions. This transition is not merely an environmental imperative but also a technological and economic evolution, promising a more sustainable and resilient energy future.\n\nAt the forefront of this revolution is solar power, which harnesses the immense energy of the sun. The most common method involves photovoltaic (PV) cells, which directly convert sunlight into electricity. Another approach, concentrated solar power (CSP), uses mirrors to focus sunlight to heat a fluid, which then creates steam to power a turbine. The primary advantages of solar energy are its abundance and its clean nature. However, its main drawback is intermittency it only generates power when the sun is shining. This necessitates the development of large-scale energy storage solutions, such as advanced batteries, to provide reliable power around the clock. Furthermore, large solar farms require significant land area, which can raise concerns about land use and ecosystem impact.\n\nWind power offers another powerful alternative. Giant turbines, often grouped together in wind farms on land or offshore, capture kinetic energy from the wind and convert it into electricity. Like solar power, wind is a clean energy source, but it shares the same challenge of intermittency, as it is dependent on weather patterns. The visual impact of turbines on landscapes and potential harm to avian wildlife, such as birds and bats, are also significant concerns that require careful planning and mitigation.\n\nHydropower and geothermal energy provide more consistent, or baseload, power. Hydropower, generated by the force of flowing water turning turbines in dams, is one of the oldest and most established forms of renewable energy. It is highly reliable and can be dispatched on demand. The main limitation is its environmental impact; large dams can alter river ecosystems, disrupt fish migration, and displace communities. Geothermal energy taps into the Earth's internal heat, using steam from underground reservoirs to generate electricity. It is a highly reliable and clean source of energy with a small physical footprint. Its primary constraint is geographical, as it is only economically viable in regions with accessible geothermal activity, such as volcanic zones or areas with tectonic plate boundaries.\n\nThe complete transition to a renewable energy system presents formidable but surmountable challenges. Beyond the intermittency of solar and wind, modernizing the electrical grid to handle decentralized energy sources is a major hurdle. Smart grids, which use digital technology to manage electricity distribution more efficiently, are essential.

It is time for a fundamental shift to a year-round schooling model. A balanced calendar, with shorter, more frequent breaks distributed throughout the year, offers a powerful solution to combat the well-documented 'summer slide'—the significant learning loss that occurs over the long summer vacation. This loss is particularly detrimental to students from low-income families, who often lack access to enriching summer activities, thus widening the achievement gap.\n\nOpponents of year-round schooling often raise concerns about disrupting family traditions and the summer tourism industry. While these are valid considerations, they pale in comparison to the profound educational benefits. Shorter breaks mean that teachers spend less time re-teaching old material in the fall, allowing them to cover more ground and delve deeper into complex topics. Furthermore, a balanced calendar can reduce teacher and student burnout by providing more frequent opportunities for rest and rejuvenation. The argument that 'kids need a break' misunderstands the nature of modern learning; the goal is not to eliminate breaks, but to distribute them more effectively to create a continuous and more engaging learning environment.\n\nUltimately, the transition to year-round schooling is not merely a logistical change; it is an investment in our children's future. It is a commitment to closing the achievement gap, improving academic retention, and creating a more efficient and effective educational system. Clinging to a calendar designed for a bygone era is a disservice to our students. We must have the courage to embrace a model that is better suited to the demands of the 21st century.","question":"The author's tone can best be described as:","answerOptions":[{"text":"uncertain and questioning.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"This is not the correct answer based on the information provided."},{"text":"humorous and lighthearted.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"This is not the correct answer based on the information provided."},{"text":"objective and detached.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"While this might seem plausible, it is not supported by the information given."},{"text":"passionate and urgent.","isCorrect":true,"rationale":"passionate and urgent."}],"challenge_tags":["rla-3"]},{"questionNumber":1,"question":"What bias does the author display in the passage?","answerOptions":[{"text":"A bias against students from low-income families.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"This answer is incorrect.

That was all. And sixty cents of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one's cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas.\n\nThere was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating.\n\nDella finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a gray cat walking a gray fence in a gray backyard. Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something fine and rare and sterling—'something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honor of being owned by Jim.\n\nSuddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its color within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length. Now, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim's gold watch that had been his father's and his grandfather's. The other was Della's hair. Had the queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty's jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy.\n\nSo now Della's beautiful hair fell about her, rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet. On went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she fluttered out the door and down the stairs to the street.","question":"The author's comparison of Della's hair to the Queen of Sheba's jewels and Jim's watch to King Solomon's treasures is an example of what literary device?","answerOptions":[{"text":"Metaphor","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"While this might seem plausible, it is not supported by the information given."},{"text":"Personification","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"This answer is incorrect.
