**CODEx DIRECTIVE: audit and repair premade quizzes (math focus)**

You are working in this project:

* **Root (frontend):** `Ged-Website/`
* **Quiz folder (current files):** `Ged-Website/public/quizzes/`

The folder currently contains files like:

* `math.quizzes.part1.json`
* `math.quizzes.part2.json`
* `rla.quizzes.part1.json`
* `rla.quizzes.part2.json`
* `science.quizzes.part1.json`
* `science.quizzes.part2.json`
* `social-studies.extras.json`
* `social-studies.quizzes.json`
* `social-studies.quizzes.bak.json`
* `social-studies.utf8.json`

(They are JSON source files even if the name doesn’t end with `.json`.)

Your task right now is **not** to refactor the whole quiz system. Your task is to **open these quiz files and review them question-by-question** and fix any gaps.

### CORE GOALS (do these in order)

1. **Every premade quiz must have at least 12 real questions.**

   * If a quiz has fewer than 12, create new questions to reach 12.
   * New questions must match the subject/topic of the quiz they’re added to.
   * Do **not** delete good existing questions just to hit 12.

2. **No placeholder / blank / broken questions.**
   Scan every question in every quiz in these files and fix/remove placeholders. Treat these as placeholders/bad items:

   * text is `""` or `null`
   * text says `"placeholder"`, `"TBD"`, `"coming soon"`, `"auto-generated"`, `"AI failed"`, or similar
   * options are empty or missing
   * a question object exists but has no `question`/`answerOptions`
     For each placeholder, **replace it with a real, unique, GED-appropriate question for that subject.** Don’t leave any blanks.

3. **Answer keys must be correct.**

   * For math especially, read the stem and recompute the answer.
   * Make sure the option marked as correct actually matches the computed result.
   * If the correct answer is wrong, fix the option text **or** move the `isCorrect: true` to the right option.
   * If the problem statement is ambiguous, clarify it so the answer is unambiguous.

---

### VERY IMPORTANT MATH NOTE

* **Do NOT convert the math questions to “plain text only.”**
* If the current question already uses a nicer math form (fraction markup, inline math-ish text, or structured wording), **keep that style.**
* When you create new math questions, match the existing style in that file (same wording style, same way numbers/fractions/expressions are shown).
* Make sure the math problems “come out well” in the UI: no half-finished fractions, no missing denominators, no “x = ?” without the expression.

---

### HOW TO AUDIT EACH FILE

For each of these files in `public/quizzes/`:

1. **Open the file.**

2. Identify the quiz objects (some files group by subject/topic — keep that structure).

3. For each quiz:

   * Count the questions.
   * If `< 12`, generate enough **unique** questions to reach 12.
   * Loop through each question object and check:

     * `question` (or `questionText`) is non-empty and meaningful.
     * `answerOptions` (or whatever the file uses) exists and has at least 3–4 options.
     * Exactly **one** option is the correct answer.
     * No option text is blank.
     * For math: rework any bad formatting so it’s readable in the app.
   * If a question is just a copied template, rewrite it so it’s distinct.

4. Save the file **with the same name and structure** the app expects.

---

### WHEN YOU HAVE TO CREATE A NEW QUESTION

* Match the subject/file you’re in.

  * `math.quizzes.part1.json` / `part2.json`: arithmetic, ratios, algebra basics, geometry/perimeter/area, data. Use the same range of difficulty the file already has.
  * Keep the tone consistent with existing questions.
* Provide 4 options.
* Mark exactly 1 as correct.
* Make the distractors plausible (same units, same order of magnitude, common computation mistakes).
* Example (for math, style only):

```
{
  "questionNumber": 9,
  "type": "multipleChoice",
  "question": "Solve for x: 3(x - 2) = 15",
  "answerOptions": [
    { "text": "x = 5", "isCorrect": true },
    { "text": "x = 3", "isCorrect": false },
    { "text": "x = 7", "isCorrect": false },
    { "text": "x = -5", "isCorrect": false }
  ]
}
```

Adjust to the exact key names the file is using — don’t invent a totally new schema if the file is already consistent.

### WHAT TO FIX IF “QUIZ QUESTIONS COME UP BLANK”

* That usually means the question text or options were missing or null.
* Replace those question objects in-place with real content.
* Do not leave any dummy objects in the array.

---

### DO NOT

* Do **not** strip out formatting from math problems.
* Do **not** rewrite the entire file into a new format that the frontend doesn’t use.
* Do **not** change folder paths — keep everything in `public/quizzes/`.
* Do **not** reduce any quiz below 12.

---

### DELIVERABLE

Updated versions of the same files in `public/quizzes/`, each quiz inspected and:

* ≥ 12 questions
* 0 placeholders/blanks
* math rendered in good form
* correct answer marked

Give that to Codex and it should walk the actual files you showed in the screenshot and just harden them, not redesign them.
