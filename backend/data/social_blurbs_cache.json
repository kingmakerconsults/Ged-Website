    "text": "The Freedmen's Bureau, officially the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, was established by the United States Congress in March 1865 to assist formerly enslaved people in the transition to freedom following the Civil War. The bureau provided emergency food, clothing, and medical care, helped negotiate labor contracts, and created schools that introduced literacy to hundreds of thousands of African Americans. Despite chronic underfunding and opposition from President Andrew Johnson and southern white supremacists, the bureau offered a measure of federal protection during Reconstruction, laying groundwork for later civil rights efforts."
