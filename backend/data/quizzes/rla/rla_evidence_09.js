    "passage": "The 'broken windows' theory of policing, which posits that cracking down on minor offenses like vandalism and public drinking can prevent more serious crimes, is a controversial one. Proponents argue that it creates an atmosphere of order and lawfulness. However, a 2018 study of crime statistics in New York City over a 30-year period found no statistically significant evidence that this strategy had an impact on the rate of serious crime. The study concluded that the dramatic drop in crime in the 1990s was better explained by other factors, such as changes in the economy and a decrease in the crack cocaine trade.",
