The production of cheap, trendy clothing consumes vast amounts of water and energy, and often involves the use of toxic dyes.

The greater the number of bystanders, the less likely it is that any one of them will help. This is attributed to a 'diffusion of responsibility,' where each person feels less personally responsible for acting because they assume someone else will.
