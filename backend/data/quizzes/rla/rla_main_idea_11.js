    "passage": "The rapid growth of the fast-fashion industry has had a significant negative impact on the environment. The production of cheap, trendy clothing consumes vast amounts of water and energy, and often involves the use of toxic dyes. Furthermore, the disposable nature of these clothes means that tons of textile waste end up in landfills each year. Consumers can mitigate this impact by choosing higher-quality, more durable clothing and by supporting sustainable brands.",

    "passage": "The bystander effect is a social psychological phenomenon in which individuals are less likely to offer help to a victim when other people are present. The greater the number of bystanders, the less likely it is that any one of them will help. This is attributed to a 'diffusion of responsibility,' where each person feels less personally responsible for acting because they assume someone else will. It is a powerful example of how the presence of others can influence individual behavior.",
