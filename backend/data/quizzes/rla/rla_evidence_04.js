    "passage": "The assertion that the 'digital age' has shortened our attention spans is a popular one, but it may be an oversimplification. While it's true that the constant stream of information can be distracting, some studies suggest that our brains are not so much losing the ability to focus as they are adapting to a new environment. For example, a 2018 study on video gamers showed they had a heightened ability to track multiple objects at once compared to non-gamers. This suggests a shift in cognitive strengths, rather than a simple deficit.",

According to the EPA, only about 30% of plastic bottles in the United States are actually recycled.
