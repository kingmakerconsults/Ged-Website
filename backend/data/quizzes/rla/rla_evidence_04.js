    passage: "A recent study by the National Transportation Institute found that cities with dedicated bus rapid transit (BRT) lanes reduced average commute times by 22% compared to cities without BRT infrastructure. Additionally, cities with BRT reported a 14% decrease in downtown parking demand, suggesting that commuters shifted to public transit when fast, reliable options were available.",
    question: "Which of the following is the MOST direct evidence that BRT lanes improve commuting?",
    answerOptions: [
      { text: "Cities with BRT reported reduced parking demand.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "This is a secondary effect, not direct evidence of commute improvement." },
      { text: "Cities with BRT averaged a 22% reduction in commute times.", isCorrect: true, rationale: "A specific, measurable percentage directly tied to commute time is the strongest direct evidence." },
      { text: "Commuters shifted to public transit where fast options existed.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "This is an inference drawn from the parking data, not a direct commute measurement." },
      { text: "The National Transportation Institute conducted a study.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "This is background context, not the evidence itself." },

    passage: "The Millbrook School District recently adopted a four-day school week. Supporters argued it would save money and reduce teacher burnout. After one year, the district reported a 12% decrease in teacher absences and roughly $200,000 in operational savings. However, some parents noted that it created childcare difficulties on the fifth day.",
    question: "A parent argues the four-day week is harmful. Which evidence from the passage BEST supports that argument?",
    answerOptions: [
      { text: "Teacher absences dropped by 12%.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "This supports the pro-four-day-week argument." },
      { text: "The district saved $200,000 in operations.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "This also supports the policy." },
      { text: "Some parents noted childcare difficulties on the fifth day.", isCorrect: true, rationale: "This is the only detail that identifies a negative consequence for families." },
      { text: "The district adopted the schedule one year ago.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "This is a timeline detail, not evidence of harm." },

    passage: "Researchers at Westbrook University investigated the relationship between green spaces and mental health in urban environments. Their results showed that city residents who spent at least 30 minutes weekly in parks or green spaces reported 18% lower levels of anxiety and a 24% improvement in self-reported wellbeing compared to those who spent no time in such spaces. The study controlled for income, age, and pre-existing conditions.",
    question: "Why does the fact that the study 'controlled for income, age, and pre-existing conditions' strengthen the evidence?",
    answerOptions: [
      { text: "It shows the researchers were highly qualified.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "Qualifications are not the same as methodological rigor." },
      { text: "It means the green-space effect cannot be explained by those other variables.", isCorrect: true, rationale: "Controlling for variables isolates the specific factor being tested, making the evidence more reliable." },
      { text: "It proves that all urban residents benefit equally.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "Controlling for variables does not mean everyone benefits equally." },
      { text: "It eliminates the need for other studies.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "One study, however rigorous, does not eliminate the need for replication." },

    questionNumber: 4,
    type: 'multipleChoice',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    passage: "Proponents of year-round schooling argue that extended summer breaks cause 'summer slide' — a loss of academic progress over the break. They cite a Johns Hopkins meta-analysis of 39 studies showing that students lose an average of two to three months of reading skills each summer. Critics counter that year-round schools have not consistently shown improved test scores over traditional schedules.",
    question: "Which statement best describes the relationship between the two pieces of evidence in the passage?",
    answerOptions: [
      { text: "Both pieces support year-round schooling.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The critics' evidence argues against a clear benefit of year-round schooling." },
      { text: "The meta-analysis proves that year-round school improves test scores.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The meta-analysis addresses summer loss, not year-round school outcomes." },
      { text: "The meta-analysis supports the claim of summer loss, while critics' data undermines the proposed solution.", isCorrect: true, rationale: "Accurately captures both sides: the problem (summer slide) is evidenced, but the solution (year-round school) is disputed." },
      { text: "The critics' data disproves the existence of summer slide.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The critics challenge the effectiveness of the solution, not the reality of summer slide." },

    type: 'multipleChoice',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    passage: "In a community debate over building a new highway through a wetland area, advocates noted that the highway would reduce commute times by 15 minutes and create 3,000 construction jobs. Environmentalists argued that destroying the wetland would eliminate habitat for 40 protected species and reduce the region's natural flood buffer by 30%, potentially costing millions in future flood damages.",
    question: "Which of the following best evaluates the strength of the environmentalists' argument?",
    answerOptions: [
      { text: "It is weak because the highway creates jobs.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "Refuting the other side's point does not weaken this argument on its own terms." },
      { text: "It is strong because it uses specific quantities to project long-term costs.", isCorrect: true, rationale: "The argument cites 40 species, 30% buffer reduction, and 'millions in damages' — specific, quantified, long-term evidence." },
      { text: "It is weak because it does not mention the commute improvement.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "Arguments don't need to address every point of the opposing side to be strong." },
      { text: "It is strong only because it mentions protected species.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The argument's strength comes from the combination of specific quantified claims, not from species alone." },

    passage: "Advertisement: 'Switch to FreshWave toothpaste — used by 4 out of 5 dentists!' A consumer advocacy group reviewed the study behind this claim and found that dentists were given only two options to choose from, and FreshWave was compared to a brand known to be ineffective. The question asked was 'Which would you recommend to patients who need whitening products?'",
    question: "How does the consumer group's finding affect the advertisement's evidence?",
    answerOptions: [
      { text: "It strengthens the claim because the study involved real dentists.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "Expert involvement doesn't validate a study with biased methodology." },
      { text: "It reveals that the statistic is misleading because of the limited comparison and narrow question.", isCorrect: true, rationale: "The limited choice set and narrow question scope make '4 out of 5' a misleading general endorsement." },
      { text: "It proves the ad is false because 4 out of 5 is not a real statistic.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The statistic may be technically accurate but is contextually misleading — not proven false." },
      { text: "It has no effect because dentists are experts.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "Expert status doesn't override flaws in the study design." },

    difficulty: 'hard',
    passage: "A city council member argues: 'We should invest in a new sports stadium. Tourism data from comparable cities show that stadium construction correlates with a 15% increase in hotel bookings. Our downtown businesses need more foot traffic, and a stadium is the answer.' An economist responds: 'Correlation between new stadiums and increased tourism is often driven by other simultaneous development — hotels, restaurants, and marketing campaigns — not the stadium alone.'",
    question: "The economist's response challenges the council member's argument by:",
    answerOptions: [
      { text: "Providing evidence that hotels, not stadiums, drive growth.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The economist doesn't provide evidence that hotels alone drive growth; they point to confounding factors." },
      { text: "Arguing that the 15% statistic is inaccurate.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The economist does not dispute the statistic, only its interpretation." },
      { text: "Questioning whether the stadium caused the tourist increase or whether other factors explain it.", isCorrect: true, rationale: "The economist attacks the causal link, not the correlation statistic — a classic 'correlation ≠ causation' challenge." },
      { text: "Suggesting that the city has enough foot traffic already.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "This interpretation does not appear in the economist's response." },

    passage: "A health agency released a report stating that a new drug reduced symptoms in 70% of patients during clinical trials. However, a pharmacologist noted that the trial lasted only 8 weeks, all participants were between 25 and 40 years old, and the placebo group showed a 45% symptom reduction. The trial included 200 patients from a single research hospital.",
    question: "Which limitation of the trial MOST weakens its evidence?",
    answerOptions: [
      { text: "Only 200 patients were studied.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "Sample size is a concern, but other limitations are more decisive here." },
      { text: "The placebo group also improved — by 45%.", isCorrect: true, rationale: "A net improvement of only 25 percentage points over placebo substantially reduces the drug's apparent effectiveness." },
      { text: "All participants were from one hospital.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "This limits generalisability but is less immediately damaging than the placebo effect comparison." },
      { text: "The trial only lasted 8 weeks.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "Duration is a concern for long-term claims, but the placebo effect is more damaging to the core claim." },

Passage B: A state education official argues that uniform standards ensure all students, regardless of zip code, receive equitable preparation for college and the workforce. She notes that districts with locally controlled standards show the widest achievement gaps between income levels.",
    question: "Which best describes how the two passages approach the question of curriculum control?",
    answerOptions: [
      { text: "Both use statistical evidence to support local control.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "Passage B argues against local control." },
      { text: "Passage A uses a single district example; Passage B uses broader demographic evidence about equity.", isCorrect: true, rationale: "Passage A relies on one district's success. Passage B cites pattern-level evidence about achievement gaps across many districts." },
      { text: "Both agree that graduation rates are the best metric.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "Passage B focuses on equity and achievement gaps, not graduation rates." },
      { text: "Passage B claims uniform standards cause achievement gaps.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "Passage B says local control is associated with wider gaps — not that uniform standards cause them." },

    passage: "An environmental group argues that plastic grocery bag bans are effective: 'After San Francisco banned single-use bags in 2007, researchers found a 72% reduction in plastic bag litter in local waterways within three years.' A packaging industry spokesperson counters: 'Consumers simply switched to heavier reusable plastic bags, which require significantly more resources to produce and have a larger carbon footprint per bag manufactured.'",
    question: "Which of the following conclusions is best supported by BOTH pieces of evidence together?",
    answerOptions: [
      { text: "Bag bans should be reversed because reusable bags are worse.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The environmental group's data contradicts this — litter fell significantly." },
      { text: "Bag bans succeed in reducing visible litter but may shift environmental costs elsewhere.", isCorrect: true, rationale: "Synthesises both: ban reduced litter (Group A's data) but created resource costs elsewhere (industry data)." },
      { text: "The industry spokesperson's data proves bag bans have no environmental benefit.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The 72% litter reduction is genuine evidence of one environmental benefit." },
      { text: "Bag bans should be expanded nationally because of the 72% reduction.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The industry data about reusable bags complicates this conclusion." },
