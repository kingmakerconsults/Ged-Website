Its primary purpose was to protect Chinese states and empires against raids and invasions from nomadic groups.

Given the vast number of stars and Earth-like planets, it seems statistically likely that intelligent life should be common. Yet, we have found no definitive proof.

    "passage": "The legal principle of 'presumption of innocence' is a cornerstone of many modern justice systems. It means that a defendant is considered innocent until the prosecution proves their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. This places the burden of proof squarely on the prosecution. This principle is not about claiming that the accused is factually innocent it is a procedural safeguard designed to protect individuals from wrongful conviction and to ensure that the state has a high bar to meet before it can deprive a citizen of their liberty.",
