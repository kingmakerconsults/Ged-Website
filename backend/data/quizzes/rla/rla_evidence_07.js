    "passage": "The company's investment in new technology has paid off, leading to a major increase in production. The new automated assembly line, which was installed in January, can produce 80 units per hour, whereas the old line could only produce 50. This has allowed the company to meet the growing demand for its product and has resulted in a 15% increase in quarterly profits.",

    "passage": "The argument that voting doesn't matter, especially in a non-presidential election, is a deeply flawed one. While a single vote may seem insignificant, local and state elections often have a far more direct impact on a citizen's daily life. These are the elections that determine the funding for your local schools, the quality of your roads, and the policies of your local police department. For instance, in 2017, a key state legislative race in Virginia was decided by a single vote out of more than 23,000 cast.",
