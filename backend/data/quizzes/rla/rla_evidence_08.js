        "text": "The park is for a wide variety of residents.",

      {
        "text": "Over 500 people attended the opening celebration.",

    "difficulty": "medium",
    "passage": "The new city-wide food composting program has had a significant environmental impact. By collecting food scraps separately from other trash, the city is able to turn this waste into valuable compost. The Department of Public Works reported that in the first six months of the program, the city diverted 5,000 tons of food waste from the landfill.",

    "answerOptions": [

      {
        "text": "The city diverted 5,000 tons of food waste from the landfill.",

    "difficulty": "hard",
    "passage": "The argument that technology is a panacea for all educational problems is a flawed one. While tablets and smartboards can be engaging tools, they are not a substitute for effective teaching and a well-designed curriculum. A 2019 meta-analysis of over 100 studies on classroom technology found no statistically significant improvement in student test scores in classrooms that had a 1:1 device-to-student ratio compared to those that did not. The study concluded that how technology is used is far more important than its mere presence.",
    "question": "Which piece of evidence from the text most effectively refutes the argument that technology is a 'panacea' (a cure-all) for education?",
    "answerOptions": [
      {
        "text": "Tablets and smartboards can be engaging tools.",
        "rationale": "This is a concession the author makes, not evidence against the 'panacea' argument.",

      {
        "text": "A meta-analysis of over 100 studies found no significant improvement in test scores from 1:1 device ratios.",
        "rationale": "Correct. This is the most powerful piece of evidence. The fact that a large-scale review of many studies found no significant impact from simply having the technology directly refutes the idea that technology is a cure-all.",
        "isCorrect": true
      },

        "text": "Technology is not a substitute for effective teaching.",
