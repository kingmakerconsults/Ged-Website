While tablets and smartboards can be engaging tools, they are not a substitute for effective teaching and a well-designed curriculum. A 2019 meta-analysis of over 100 studies on classroom technology found no statistically significant improvement in student test scores in classrooms that had a 1:1 device-to-student ratio compared to those that did not.
