    "passage": "The phenomenon known as 'colony collapse disorder' (CCD) in honeybees has been a major concern for scientists and farmers for over a decade. It is a complex problem with no single cause. Researchers have identified several contributing factors, including exposure to pesticides, infection by mites and viruses, and poor nutrition due to habitat loss. The synergistic effect of these stressors seems to weaken the bees' immune systems, making them more susceptible to collapse. The loss of bees is a critical issue, as they are essential for pollinating a third of our food supply.",
