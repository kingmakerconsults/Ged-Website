It is a complex problem with no single cause. Researchers have identified several contributing factors, including exposure to pesticides, infection by mites and viruses, and poor nutrition due to habitat loss. The synergistic effect of these stressors seems to weaken the bees' immune systems, making them more susceptible to collapse.
