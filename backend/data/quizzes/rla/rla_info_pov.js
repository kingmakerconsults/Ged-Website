    passage:
      "The traditional ten-month school calendar, with its long summer break, is an outdated relic of an agrarian past that no longer serves the needs of modern students. It is time for a fundamental shift to a year-round schooling model. A balanced calendar, with shorter, more frequent breaks distributed throughout the year, offers a powerful solution to combat the well-documented 'summer slide'—the significant learning loss that occurs over the long summer vacation. This loss is particularly detrimental to students from low-income families, who often lack access to enriching summer activities, thus widening the achievement gap.\n\nOpponents of year-round schooling often raise concerns about disrupting family traditions and the summer tourism industry. While these are valid considerations, they pale in comparison to the profound educational benefits. Shorter breaks mean that teachers spend less time re-teaching old material in the fall, allowing them to cover more ground and delve deeper into complex topics. Furthermore, a balanced calendar can reduce teacher and student burnout by providing more frequent opportunities for rest and rejuvenation. The argument that 'kids need a break' misunderstands the nature of modern learning; the goal is not to eliminate breaks, but to distribute them more effectively to create a continuous and more engaging learning environment.\n\nUltimately, the transition to year-round schooling is not merely a logistical change; it is an investment in our children's future. It is a commitment to closing the achievement gap, improving academic retention, and creating a more efficient and effective educational system. Clinging to a calendar designed for a bygone era is a disservice to our students. We must have the courage to embrace a model that is better suited to the demands of the 21st century.",
