Rising ocean temperatures lead to coral bleaching, a phenomenon where corals expel the algae living in their tissues, causing them to turn completely white. While corals can survive a bleaching event, they are under more stress and are subject to mortality. According to a 2018 study, the reef has lost half of its coral populations over the past three decades.",
