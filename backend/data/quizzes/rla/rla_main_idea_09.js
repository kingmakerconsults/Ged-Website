    "passage": "The concept of 'food miles'—the distance food is transported from the time of its production until it reaches the consumer—is an important consideration in environmental sustainability. Foods that are shipped long distances, especially by air, have a much larger carbon footprint than locally sourced foods. Supporting local farmers' markets and choosing seasonal produce are effective ways for consumers to reduce their food miles and contribute to a healthier planet.",

    "passage": "The Bletchley Park codebreakers of World War II were instrumental in the Allied victory. Their work in cracking the German Enigma code has been widely celebrated. However, a lesser-known but equally vital part of their operation was the breaking of the Lorenz cipher, a far more complex code used for high-level German communications. The decryption of Lorenz messages provided the Allies with crucial intelligence about German military strategy, including detailed plans for the defense of Normandy before the D-Day invasion. The ingenuity of the codebreakers who unraveled Lorenz, and the mechanical computer they built to do so, was a monumental achievement that remained classified for decades.",
