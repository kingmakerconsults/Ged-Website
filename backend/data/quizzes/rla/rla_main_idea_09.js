    passage: "The Marshall Plan, formally the European Recovery Program (1948-1952), provided $13 billion in American economic assistance to rebuild Western European economies devastated by World War II. The plan's architects — Secretary of State George Marshall and undersecretary Dean Acheson — argued that stable, prosperous democracies would resist communist influence. The plan rebuilt European industrial capacity, stabilised currencies, and fostered cooperative institutions that eventually evolved into the European Union. Critics have noted that the plan also served American strategic and economic interests by creating export markets for U.S. goods.",
    question: "What is the main idea of the passage?",
    answerOptions: [
      { text: "The Marshall Plan was a purely selfless act of American generosity with no strategic motivation.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The passage explicitly notes the plan served American strategic and economic interests." },
      { text: "The Marshall Plan successfully rebuilt Western Europe while simultaneously advancing American strategic interests and laying institutional groundwork for European cooperation.", isCorrect: true,  rationale: "Correctly integrates all elements: reconstruction success, strategic motive, and institutional legacy." },
      { text: "Dean Acheson was solely responsible for designing and implementing the Marshall Plan.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "Both Marshall and Acheson are credited as architects — singling out Acheson alone misrepresents the passage." },
      { text: "The Marshall Plan directly caused the founding of NATO.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The passage connects the plan to institutions that became the EU — NATO is not mentioned." },
