   question:"Which sentence should be rewritten in active voice for consistency with the rest of the paragraph?",
   answerOptions:[
    {text:"Sentence 1", isCorrect:false, rationale:"Already active."},
    {text:"Sentence 2", isCorrect:false, rationale:"Passive but acceptable as a short transitional statement."},
    {text:"Sentence 3", isCorrect:true, rationale:"'The decision was made by the board' should be 'The board made the decision' — active and consistent with sentences 1 and 2."},
    {text:"Sentence 4", isCorrect:false, rationale:"Passive is acceptable here — it emphasises the announcement rather than who issues it."},

   question:"Choose the transition word that best connects these sentences logically:\n'The construction project was delayed by two months. _______, the final cost exceeded the original budget by 15%.'",
   answerOptions:[
    {text:"However", isCorrect:false, rationale:"'However' signals contrast — a cost overrun after a delay is not a contrast."},
    {text:"Consequently", isCorrect:true, rationale:"A delay causing a cost overrun is a cause-and-effect relationship — 'consequently' is correct."},
    {text:"In addition", isCorrect:false, rationale:"'In addition' would suggest a separate, unrelated problem — not a direct consequence."},
    {text:"For example", isCorrect:false, rationale:"The cost issue is a consequence, not an example of the delay."},

  {questionNumber:3,type:'multipleChoice',difficulty:'medium',
   question:"Which revision converts the following sentence to active voice correctly?\nOriginal: 'The analysis was conducted by a team of independent researchers.'",
   answerOptions:[
    {text:"An analysis was conducting by a team of independent researchers.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"'Was conducting' is an incorrect construction."},
    {text:"A team of independent researchers conducted the analysis.", isCorrect:true, rationale:"Subject (team) → verb (conducted) → object (analysis) — clean active voice."},
    {text:"Conducted by a team of independent researchers, the analysis was completed.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"Still passive in the main clause."},
    {text:"The analysis conducted a team of independent researchers.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"Changes meaning entirely — now 'analysis' is the agent."},

  {questionNumber:4,type:'multipleChoice',difficulty:'hard',
   passage:"The following paragraph has a transition problem. (1) The new training programme cut onboarding time by 40%. (2) The pilot cohort completed it in an average of three days. (3) Similarly, customer satisfaction scores improved by 12% in the following quarter. (4) Management has approved a full rollout.",
   question:"Which transition in the paragraph is logically incorrect?",
   answerOptions:[
    {text:"No transition error exists.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"There is a transition issue between sentences 2 and 3."},
    {text:"'Similarly' at the start of sentence 3 is incorrect — improved customer satisfaction is a result of the training, not a similar parallel event.", isCorrect:true, rationale:"'Similarly' implies two parallel items of the same type; customer satisfaction improving is a consequence of the training, not a parallel fact. 'As a result' would be appropriate."},
    {text:"Sentence 4 needs a transition showing time.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"The main issue is in sentence 3."},
    {text:"Sentence 1 needs a transition.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"Sentence 1 opens the paragraph — no prior sentence to transition from."},

  {questionNumber:5,type:'multipleChoice',difficulty:'hard',
   question:"A writer produces: 'Due to the fact that the report was not completed in a timely fashion, the presentation was postponed.' Which is the most concise revision?",
   answerOptions:[
    {text:"Because the report was late, the presentation was postponed.", isCorrect:true, rationale:"'Due to the fact that' → 'Because'; 'not completed in a timely fashion' → 'late.' Clean, correct, concise."},
    {text:"The presentation was postponed due to the late report.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"Acceptable but slightly passive in feel; the first option is cleaner."},
    {text:"Because of the fact that the report was not done on time, the presentation was postponed.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"Still wordy — 'because of the fact that' is only slightly better than 'due to the fact that.'"},
    {text:"The report being late caused the presentation to be postponed.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"Grammatical but unnecessarily complex."},

   passage:"From a business letter:\n\n'We are writing to you today for the purpose of informing you that your account balance has become overdue. It is necessary that payment be made immediately.

   question:"Which revision makes this paragraph most concise without losing its professional tone?",
   answerOptions:[
    {text:"Your account is overdue. Please pay immediately and contact our office at your earliest convenience.", isCorrect:true, rationale:"Every deadwood phrase is eliminated while maintaining professionalism and urgency."},
    {text:"We are informing you your account is overdue. Pay now and call us.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"'Pay now and call us' is too informal for a business letter."},
    {text:"Your account balance has become overdue. Please make payment and contact us soon.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"Better than original but 'has become overdue' and 'make payment' are still slightly wordy."},
    {text:"For the purpose of this letter: overdue account, please pay, please contact.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"Fragment-style bullet content is inappropriate for a formal business letter."},

  {questionNumber:8,type:'multipleChoice',difficulty:'hard',
   question:"A paragraph begins: 'Many employees report high levels of stress. Workplace stress leads to lower productivity and higher turnover. _______, organisations that invest in wellness programmes see measurable returns.' Which transition fits best?",
   answerOptions:[
    {text:"In contrast", isCorrect:false, rationale:"The wellness outcome doesn't contrast with workplace stress — it responds to it."},
    {text:"In spite of this", isCorrect:false, rationale:"Same issue — this implies contradiction, not a solution."},
    {text:"Not surprisingly, then", isCorrect:true, rationale:"Given what's stated, organisations investing in wellness seeing returns is a logical, expected outcome — 'not surprisingly, then' connects cause to reasonable solution."},
    {text:"Meanwhile", isCorrect:false, rationale:"'Meanwhile' suggests simultaneous events, not a logical consequence."},

   passage:"(1) Solar panels have become increasingly affordable over the past decade. (2) Installation costs have dropped by over 70% since 2010. (3) Many homeowners are still hesitant to install them. (4) The upfront cost remains significant despite long-term savings.",
   question:"What transition word or phrase would BEST open sentence 3 to show the contrast with sentences 1 and 2?",
   answerOptions:[
    {text:"Therefore", isCorrect:false, rationale:"'Therefore' signals a logical result — hesitancy is the opposite of the expected result from falling prices."},
    {text:"Similarly", isCorrect:false, rationale:"'Similarly' signals a parallel point, not a contradiction."},
    {text:"Despite this progress", isCorrect:true, rationale:"Acknowledges the preceding cost-reduction trend while introducing the contradictory hesitancy — precise and appropriate."},
    {text:"As a result", isCorrect:false, rationale:"Hesitancy as a result of cheaper panels is counterintuitive."},

    {text:"Because the report was incomplete, the board postponed its vote.", isCorrect:true, rationale:"Direct, concise causal statement using a subordinating conjunction."},
    {text:"The report was incomplete, and the board postponed its vote as a consequence of this.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"'As a consequence of this' is wordy when 'because' can do the same job."},
    {text:"Due to the incomplete nature of the report, a postponement of the vote was made by the board.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"Wordy and passive."},
    {text:"The board postponed its vote; the report was incomplete.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"A semicolon juxtaposes without showing the causal relationship — less precise."},
