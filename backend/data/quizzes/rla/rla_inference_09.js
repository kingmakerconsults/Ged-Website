        "text": "She is telling him that he needs to clean his room.",

    "difficulty": "medium",
    "passage": "The candidate's speech was a masterclass in ambiguity. He promised 'prosperity for all' without detailing any economic policies. He vowed to 'strengthen our communities' without mentioning a single specific program. He spoke of 'a brighter future' but offered no roadmap to get there. He left the stage to thunderous applause.",

    "difficulty": "hard",
    "passage": "It is often said that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. This is a comforting thought, but it is also a misleading one. It implies a smooth, linear progression. In my experience, the journey is less of a straight road and more of a dense, tangled forest. The first step is easy it is the hundredth, when you are lost and exhausted, that truly tests your resolve. It is the moment you decide to take the hundred-and-first step, and not the first, that defines the journey.",

        "text": "To offer a more realistic and challenging perspective on the nature of long journeys, emphasizing perseverance over initiation.",
        "rationale": "Correct. The author's purpose is to critique the simplicity of the original proverb and to propose a new, more realistic metaphor that values resilience in the middle of the struggle over the simple act of starting.",

      {
        "text": "To tell a story about a time they were lost in a forest.",

        "text": "To persuade the reader never to start a long journey.",
