    "passage": "The candidate's speech was a masterclass in ambiguity. He promised 'prosperity for all' without detailing any economic policies.

    "passage": "It is often said that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. This is a comforting thought, but it is also a misleading one. It implies a smooth, linear progression. In my experience, the journey is less of a straight road and more of a dense, tangled forest. The first step is easy it is the hundredth, when you are lost and exhausted, that truly tests your resolve. It is the moment you decide to take the hundred-and-first step, and not the first, that defines the journey.",
