    passage: "The town of Millbridge cancelled its annual summer festival for the third consecutive year, citing 'financial constraints and insufficient volunteer coordination.' Last year's festival had attracted 8,000 visitors and generated an estimated $400,000 for local businesses. The mayor released a statement saying the town 'looks forward to exploring new options for community celebration in coming years.'",
    question: "What can most reasonably be inferred from the mayor's statement?",
    answerOptions: [
      { text: "The mayor plans to hold three festivals next year to make up for lost years.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "Nothing in the statement suggests multiple festivals — it is deliberately vague." },
      { text: "The mayor is being diplomatically vague, leaving open the possibility that the festival may not return in its previous form.", isCorrect: true, rationale: "'Exploring new options' and 'in coming years' are non-committal — standard political phrasing when a tradition may be ending without saying so directly." },
      { text: "The festival was cancelled because visitors stopped attending.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "8,000 visitors in the last held year suggests strong attendance — cancellation was due to finances and volunteers." },
      { text: "Millbridge has decided to permanently eliminate all public celebrations.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The mayor's statement specifically mentions 'community celebration' — a permanent ban is not implied." },

    questionNumber: 2, type: 'multipleChoice', difficulty: 'easy',
    passage: "Ancient Romans built aqueducts — engineered stone channels — to carry fresh water from mountain springs into cities, sometimes over distances of 100 kilometres. The aqueducts used gravity alone, with the channel graded at a precise and consistent slight downhill angle. Some Roman aqueducts are still partially functioning today.",
    question: "What does the fact that some aqueducts are still partially functioning imply?",
    answerOptions: [
      { text: "Roman engineers had access to modern concrete technology.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "Romans used their own concrete — calling it 'modern' is anachronistic." },
      { text: "The Romans built with remarkable durability and engineering precision that has allowed structures to survive 2,000 years.", isCorrect: true, rationale: "Still-functional infrastructure after 2,000 years is direct evidence of exceptional construction quality and design." },
      { text: "The Romans built aqueducts using iron pipes that will never corrode.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The passage describes stone channels, not iron pipes." },
      { text: "Modern engineers have had to completely rebuild the aqueducts in recent centuries.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "'Partially functioning' implies the original structures remained — not that they were fully rebuilt." },

    questionNumber: 3, type: 'multipleChoice', difficulty: 'medium',
    passage: "From a short story: When David's phone buzzed with a number he didn't recognise, he let it go to voicemail. An hour later, checking the message, he heard his daughter's voice: 'Dad, I borrowed a friend's phone. Please call me back.' He stared at the screen for a long moment, then called — not the number she'd called from, but his daughter's own number.",
    question: "Why did David call his daughter's own number rather than the number she called from?",
    answerOptions: [
      { text: "He had forgotten the number she called from.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "He had just listened to the message — the number would be present on the screen." },
      { text: "He was suspicious that the voicemail was not actually from his daughter and wanted to verify by calling her known number.", isCorrect: true, rationale: "The deliberate pause and choice to call her direct number — rather than the number left — suggests he wanted to confirm the caller's identity through a trusted contact point." },
      { text: "He didn't know how to return calls from unknown numbers on his phone.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The passage doesn't support technophobia — his behaviour is deliberate, not confused." },
      { text: "He wanted to congratulate his daughter on getting a new phone.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "Nothing suggests this — the message said she borrowed a friend's phone." },

    questionNumber: 4, type: 'multipleChoice', difficulty: 'medium',
    passage: "From 1950 to 1970, the U.S. government built the Interstate Highway System — 47,000 miles of limited-access highways connecting every major American city. The project cost $425 billion in today's dollars. Simultaneously, mass transit ridership in American cities fell by more than 60% between 1950 and 1970, and dozens of urban streetcar systems were dismantled during this period.",
    question: "What is the most reasonable inference about the relationship between these two trends?",
    answerOptions: [
      { text: "Interstate highways caused public transit companies to improve their service quality.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The opposite happened — ridership fell dramatically while highways were built." },
      { text: "The massive federal investment in highways made car travel so convenient that public transit use declined sharply.", isCorrect: true, rationale: "Simultaneous highway expansion and dramatic transit decline is most logically explained by a causal relationship — cars became the practical default as highways made driving more attractive." },
      { text: "Americans stopped using transit because it became too expensive during this period.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "Pricing is not mentioned — the passage points to infrastructure investment as the key variable." },
      { text: "Streetcar companies went bankrupt before 1950 because of poor management.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The timeline shows dismantling happened during 1950-1970, concurrent with highway construction." },

    questionNumber: 5, type: 'multipleChoice', difficulty: 'hard',
    passage: "From a science article: For decades, astronomers accepted that the universe was electrically neutral at the largest scales — that positive and negative charges balanced out in cosmic structures. Then, in the 1990s, instruments sensitive enough to detect weak magnetic fields found that the filaments connecting galaxy clusters appear to carry faint, structured magnetic fields. No existing model of cosmic formation fully explains these fields. Some researchers now wonder whether large-scale electromagnetic forces may play a role in cosmic structure that has been systematically underestimated.",
    question: "What can be inferred about the state of cosmological science from this passage?",
    answerOptions: [
      { text: "Physics has fully explained all features of the universe and no major revisions are needed.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The discovery of unexplained cosmic magnetic fields directly contradicts this." },
      { text: "The discovery of unexpected cosmic magnetic fields suggests that current cosmological models may be incomplete and open to significant revision.", isCorrect: true, rationale: "'No existing model fully explains' the fields, and researchers are reopening the question of electromagnetic forces — a clear signal of potential model revision." },
      { text: "Astronomers in the 1990s were incompetent and failed to notice obvious magnetic fields.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The fields were undetected because instruments weren't sensitive enough — not because of incompetence." },
      { text: "The universe is definitively electrically charged at all scales.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The passage says the fields exist in filaments between galaxy clusters — not that the universe is entirely charged." },

    questionNumber: 6, type: 'multipleChoice', difficulty: 'hard',
    passage: "From a literary excerpt: 'When the company announced it was relocating its headquarters to Denver, nobody was more publicly supportive than Regional Vice President Norris. He sent encouraging emails to staff, hosted town halls about the exciting opportunities ahead, and volunteered to chair the relocation committee. Three weeks after the move was complete, Norris submitted his resignation.'",
    question: "What do Norris's actions before and after the move suggest?",
    answerOptions: [
      { text: "Norris was sincerely enthusiastic about the relocation and resigned for unrelated personal reasons.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The deliberate proximity of the resignation (three weeks after completion) makes unrelated reasons implausible as the most likely interpretation." },
      { text: "Norris privately opposed the relocation but used public support to manage his professional standing until a more convenient moment to leave.", isCorrect: true, rationale: "The pattern — strong public support, volunteering to lead, then immediate post-completion resignation — suggests his support was strategic rather than genuine." },
      { text: "Norris was forced to resign by his superiors after the move.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "'Submitted his resignation' implies a voluntary act." },
      { text: "Denver's job market has no opportunities for Vice Presidents.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "This is speculation not supported by the passage." },

    questionNumber: 7, type: 'multipleChoice', difficulty: 'hard',
    passage: "In the decade following the introduction of smartphones in 2007, rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide attempts among American teenagers — particularly girls — rose sharply. Researcher Jean Twenge documented the shift, noting that teen social life migrated from in-person hangouts to phone-based communication. Her correlational data showed that teens who spent 5 or more hours daily on their phones were 66% more likely to have at least one risk factor for suicide.",
    question: "Which inference is most appropriately cautious given that the study is correlational?",
    answerOptions: [
      { text: "Smartphones definitely cause teen mental health decline.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "'Definitely cause' is too strong — correlation does not establish causation." },
      { text: "There is a strong correlation between heavy smartphone use and teen mental health risk factors, suggesting a possible relationship that warrants further causal investigation.", isCorrect: true, rationale: "Acknowledges the finding (strong correlation) while appropriately limiting the inference to 'possible relationship' and calling for causal research." },
      { text: "The timing is coincidental and smartphones have no relationship to teen mental health.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The 66% correlation with risk factors is too strong to dismiss as coincidental." },
      { text: "All teens who use smartphones 5 hours daily will develop suicidal ideation.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "'All' is far beyond what a correlation study demonstrates." },

    questionNumber: 8, type: 'multipleChoice', difficulty: 'hard',
    passage: "From a scientific journal abstract: A study of 400 professional athletes found that those who participated in structured mindfulness training for 8 weeks showed a 31% reduction in self-reported anxiety around competition and a 22% improvement in reaction time on standardised tests. A control group of 400 athletes in the same sport who did not receive mindfulness training showed no significant change in either measure over the same period.",
    question: "What makes this study's evidence stronger than a study without a control group?",
    answerOptions: [
      { text: "The study used professional athletes, who are more reliable reporters.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The control group design, not the subject population, is what strengthens the evidence." },
      { text: "The control group allows us to determine that the improvements in the mindfulness group are not simply due to time passing, training effects, or natural variation.", isCorrect: true, rationale: "If the control group showed no change, the improvements in the mindfulness group cannot be attributed to non-intervention factors — the control group isolates the effect." },
      { text: "Having 400 athletes is the minimum scientifically valid sample size.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "No such universal minimum is established — and that isn't the issue that control groups address." },
      { text: "The study was 8 weeks long, which is the optimal research duration.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "Duration is separate from the methodological value of a control group." },

    questionNumber: 9, type: 'multipleChoice', difficulty: 'hard',
    passage: "From an 1845 political speech: 'Gentlemen, our nation is young and its greatness is not yet achieved; it lies ahead of us, in the vast territories that Providence has clearly destined to be ours. The peoples who now roam these lands will adapt to civilised ways, or they will perish — as all races unfitted for progress must ultimately perish before superior ones.'",
    question: "What does this speech reveal about the ideological framework used to justify westward expansion?",
    answerOptions: [
      { text: "The speaker was trying to protect the rights of all people living on the continent.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The speech explicitly frames other peoples as 'unfitted for progress' — not as equal rights-holders." },
      { text: "The speaker used racial hierarchy and religious justification (Providence) to frame territorial conquest as inevitable and morally sanctioned.", isCorrect: true, rationale: "The speech combines racial hierarchy ('superior races') and divine mandate ('Providence') to reframe conquest as natural law — a clear ideological framework." },
      { text: "The speaker opposed westward expansion.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The speech advocates for expansion." },
      { text: "The speaker's views represent modern American values.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "These views represent 19th-century Manifest Destiny ideology — they are explicitly contradicted by modern constitutional and civil rights principles." },

    questionNumber: 10, type: 'multipleChoice', difficulty: 'hard',
    passage: "From a literary excerpt: The courtroom fell silent as the judge read the verdict aloud. Marcus kept his face still. He had learned, over twenty-three years of trying cases, that jurors watch the attorney's face when the verdict is read — that any flicker is interpreted as either relief or defeat, smugness or surprise, all of which can undo future cases with the same jury pool. Only after the door to the parking garage closed behind him did he allow himself to exhale slowly, lower himself onto a parking block, and rest his head in his hands.",
    question: "What does the contrast between Marcus's courtroom behaviour and his parking garage behaviour most reveal?",
    answerOptions: [
      { text: "Marcus is a cold person who never truly cares about his cases.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "His collapse in the parking garage shows he cares deeply — courtroom restraint is professional, not personal coldness." },
      { text: "Marcus maintains rigid professional composure in public while experiencing genuine emotional release only when no one is watching — suggesting the verdict was significant and the controlled exterior cost him effort.", isCorrect: true, rationale: "The post-verdict exhale, the descent onto a parking block, and head in hands are unmistakable signs of emotional release after sustained suppression." },
      { text: "Marcus won the case and is celebrating alone.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "Head in hands is not a celebration gesture — the emotional context is ambiguous but heavy, not triumphant." },
      { text: "Marcus forgot to eat and is simply tired after a long day.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The passage frames everything around the verdict and professional composure — fatigue is not the explanation offered." },
