    "passage": "The global supply chain is a complex network of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources involved in moving a product from supplier to customer. In recent years, this intricate system has become increasingly vulnerable to disruptions, such as pandemics, trade disputes, and extreme weather events.

    "passage": "The concept of 'neuroplasticity' has revolutionized our understanding of the brain. For a long time, it was believed that the adult brain was a static, unchanging organ. However, research over the past few decades has shown that the brain has a remarkable ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. This can happen in response to learning, experience, or following an injury. This discovery has profound implications for rehabilitation after brain damage and for our understanding of learning and memory.",
