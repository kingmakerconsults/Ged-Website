    passage: "In the early 20th century, American cities faced a sanitation crisis. Rapidly growing industrial populations produced volumes of waste that overwhelmed existing systems. Tuberculosis, typhoid, and cholera killed tens of thousands annually. Progressive Era reformers — many of them women excluded from formal political life — organised to demand public health infrastructure: clean water systems, sewage treatment, food inspection laws, and public health nurses. Their campaigns directly contributed to a drop in urban mortality rates and helped establish the principles of modern public health governance.",
    question: "What is the main idea of the passage?",
    answerOptions: [
      { text: "Cities were clean and well-managed before Progressive Era reformers arrived.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The passage opens by describing the crisis — cities were overwhelmed and disease was rampant." },
      { text: "Women-led Progressive Era civic reform drove critical public health infrastructure that reduced urban mortality and shaped modern governance.", isCorrect: true,  rationale: "Captures actors (women reformers), actions (infrastructure demands), and outcomes (lower mortality, modern governance)." },
      { text: "Progressive Era reform was primarily about voting rights, not sanitation.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The passage focuses entirely on public health and sanitation reform — voting rights are not mentioned." },
      { text: "Public health improvements in this era were led by wealthy male political leaders.", isCorrect: false, rationale: "The passage explicitly identifies the reformers as women excluded from formal political life." },
