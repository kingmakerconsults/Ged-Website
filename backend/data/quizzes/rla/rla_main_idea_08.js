Unlike IQ, which measures cognitive ability, EQ refers to the ability to perceive, understand, and manage one's own emotions, as well as those of others.

    "passage": "The 'placebo effect' is a fascinating and well-documented phenomenon in medicine. It occurs when a patient experiences real physiological or psychological improvements after receiving a treatment with no active therapeutic substance, such as a sugar pill. The patient's belief in the treatment is what triggers the healing effect. This is not to say that the symptoms were imaginary the relief is real. The placebo effect complicates clinical trials, which must be designed to distinguish between the effects of a new drug and the effects of a patient's belief. It also highlights the powerful and complex connection between the mind and the body.",
