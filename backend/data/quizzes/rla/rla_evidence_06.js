    "passage": "Learning to cook at home is a great way to improve your diet and save money. When you cook your own meals, you have complete control over the ingredients, allowing you to reduce your intake of salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats.

While some AI, like a calculator, is designed for a single purpose, the frontier of AI research is 'general intelligence'â€”an AI that can think, learn, and adapt across a wide variety of tasks. A 2022 survey of AI researchers found that a majority believe there is a greater than 10% chance that an AI of this nature could lead to a catastrophic outcome for humanity. The issue is not one of control, but of alignment: ensuring that a superintelligent AI's goals are aligned with our own.",
