    "passage": "The old theater was a glorious ruin. Velvet ropes, once a rich crimson, were now a dusty pink. Gold leaf peeled from the ornate ceiling, and the stage was a dark, silent mouth. It was a place where memories of thunderous applause and standing ovations echoed in the silence.",

    "difficulty": "hard",
    "passage": "The company's new 'unlimited vacation' policy sounds generous, but it has a catch. Because the policy does not specify a set number of days off, there is no requirement for the company to pay out unused vacation time when an employee leaves. The policy, framed as a benefit, is also a clever way for the company to save a significant amount of money.",

      {
        "text": "To reveal an unstated, negative financial consequence of a seemingly positive company policy.",
        "rationale": "Correct. The author's purpose is to look behind the positive framing of the policy to expose a hidden, negative financial aspect that benefits the company at the expense of the employee.",
