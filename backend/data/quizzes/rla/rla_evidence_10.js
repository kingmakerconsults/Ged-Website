    "passage": "The argument that talent is a more important factor than practice in achieving expertise is a common but flawed one. While innate ability can certainly play a role, a large body of research supports the primacy of 'deliberate practice.' A famous 1993 study of violinists, for example, found that the most accomplished performers had all accumulated at least 10,000 hours of practice by age 20. The study found no examples of 'naturals' who had risen to the top without extensive practice. The key to expertise, it seems, is not the gift, but the grind.",
