   question:"Which sentence is correctly punctuated?",
   answerOptions:[
    {text:"I wanted to go; but it was raining.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"Don't use a semicolon before a coordinating conjunction like 'but' when connecting two main clauses — use a comma."},
    {text:"I wanted to go, but it was raining.", isCorrect:true, rationale:"Comma before a coordinating conjunction joining two independent clauses is correct."},
    {text:"I wanted to go but, it was raining.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"The comma belongs before 'but,' not after."},
    {text:"I wanted to go but it was raining.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"A comma is required before the coordinating conjunction in a compound sentence."},

  {questionNumber:2,type:'multipleChoice',difficulty:'easy',
   question:"Identify the sentence with the correct use of 'its' vs. 'it's'.",
   answerOptions:[
    {text:"The company lost it's lease on the building.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"'It's' = 'it is' — the possessive is 'its' (no apostrophe)."},
    {text:"The company lost its lease on the building.", isCorrect:true, rationale:"'Its' (no apostrophe) is the possessive pronoun — correct here."},
    {text:"The company lost its' lease on the building.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"'Its'' is not a valid form; the possessive is simply 'its.'"},
    {text:"The company lost their lease on the building.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"'Their' is plural; a single company uses 'its.'"},

  {questionNumber:3,type:'multipleChoice',difficulty:'medium',
   question:"Which revision corrects the dangling modifier?\nOriginal: After completing the safety training, the machines can be operated.",
   answerOptions:[
    {text:"After completing the safety training, the machines can be operated.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"The machines cannot complete training — the doer is missing."},
    {text:"After employees complete the safety training, they can operate the machines.", isCorrect:true, rationale:"The subject performing training (employees) is now explicit and correctly tied to the modifier."},
    {text:"The safety training completed, the machines can be operated.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"Still ambiguous about who completed the training."},
    {text:"Having completed, the machines can be operated by employees.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"'Having completed' still modifies 'machines,' which is illogical."},

  {questionNumber:4,type:'multipleChoice',difficulty:'medium',
   question:"Choose the sentence that uses commas correctly with a non-restrictive clause.",
   answerOptions:[
    {text:"The report, which was due last Friday was submitted on Monday.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"Both commas are needed around the non-restrictive clause: 'which was due last Friday,'"},
    {text:"The report which was due last Friday, was submitted on Monday.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"A comma before 'which' is needed; the comma placement here is wrong."},
    {text:"The report, which was due last Friday, was submitted on Monday.", isCorrect:true, rationale:"Non-restrictive clause is correctly set off by two commas."},
    {text:"The report which was due last Friday was submitted on Monday.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"Without commas, 'which was due last Friday' reads as restrictive — but the sentence implies we know which report."},

  {questionNumber:5,type:'multipleChoice',difficulty:'medium',
   question:"Which sentence uses the correct verb tense?",
   answerOptions:[
    {text:"By the time Elena arrived, the meeting already ends.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"'Ends' (simple present) clashes with the past-time context — should be 'had already ended' (past perfect)."},
    {text:"By the time Elena arrives, the meeting had already ended.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"'Arrives' (present) doesn't match the past perfect 'had ended.'"},
    {text:"By the time Elena arrived, the meeting had already ended.", isCorrect:true, rationale:"Past perfect (had ended) correctly shows the meeting finished before Elena's arrival (simple past)."},
    {text:"By the time Elena will arrive, the meeting had already ended.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"'Will arrive' (future) conflicts with past perfect context."},

  {questionNumber:6,type:'multipleChoice',difficulty:'hard',
   passage:"The following paragraph contains one unclear pronoun reference:\n(1) The consultant presented the findings to the manager. (2) She said the results were surprising but not alarming. (3) The manager told the board that she planned to act on the recommendations immediately.",
   question:"Which sentence has an unclear pronoun reference?",
   answerOptions:[
    {text:"Sentence 1", isCorrect:false, rationale:"No pronoun — two named people are introduced clearly."},
    {text:"Sentence 2", isCorrect:true, rationale:"'She' could refer to either the consultant or the manager — the antecedent is ambiguous."},
    {text:"Sentence 3", isCorrect:false, rationale:"'She' in sentence 3 clearly refers to the manager (who was the subject of sentence 2's context)."},
    {text:"Sentences 2 and 3 both have unclear references.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"Sentence 3's 'she' is clarified by the surrounding context."},

  {questionNumber:7,type:'multipleChoice',difficulty:'hard',
   question:"Choose the correctly written sentence.",
   answerOptions:[
    {text:"Neither the supervisor nor the employees was informed about the change.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"With 'neither…nor,' the verb agrees with the nearer noun ('employees,' plural), so 'were' is correct."},
    {text:"Neither the supervisor nor the employees were informed about the change.", isCorrect:true, rationale:"'Were' agrees with 'employees' — the closer subject in a neither/nor construction."},
    {text:"Neither the supervisor nor the employees are informed about the change.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"'Are' is present tense; the context (an announcement about a past event) requires past tense."},
    {text:"Neither the supervisor or the employees were informed about the change.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"'Neither' pairs with 'nor,' not 'or.'"},

  {questionNumber:8,type:'multipleChoice',difficulty:'hard',
   question:"A writer has: 'The new law will effect significant changes in the tax code.' What, if anything, should be changed?",
   answerOptions:[
    {text:"Nothing — the sentence is correct.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"'Effect' as a verb means 'to bring about' — which is technically correct here, but most test contexts expect 'affect.'"},
    {text:"Change 'effect' to 'affect' — the verb meaning 'to influence or change.'", isCorrect:true, rationale:"In most GED contexts, 'affect' (verb = to influence) is the expected choice here; 'effect' as a verb meaning 'to bring about' is rare and formal."},
    {text:"Change 'will effect' to 'will effects.'", isCorrect:false, rationale:"'Effects' is a noun — cannot follow 'will' as a verb form."},
    {text:"Change 'significant' to 'significantly.'", isCorrect:false, rationale:"'Significant' correctly modifies the noun 'changes' — no change needed there."},

  {questionNumber:9,type:'multipleChoice',difficulty:'hard',
   question:"Which sentence uses the subjunctive mood correctly?",
   answerOptions:[
    {text:"If I was the director, I would expand the programme.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"In a hypothetical contrary-to-fact 'if' clause, use 'were': 'If I were the director.'"},
    {text:"If I were the director, I would expand the programme.", isCorrect:true, rationale:"'Were' is the subjunctive form required in hypothetical conditions."},
    {text:"If I am the director, I would expand the programme.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"'Am' (indicative) is for real, not hypothetical, conditions."},
    {text:"If I were the director, I will expand the programme.", isCorrect:false, rationale:"The conditional structure requires 'would,' not 'will,' in the result clause."},

  {questionNumber:10,type:'multipleChoice',difficulty:'hard',
   passage:"A business proposal contains the following sentence: 'The committee hopes to complete the review quick and make an announcement soon.' Identify and fix the error.",
   question:"What is the error and the correct revision?",
   answerOptions:[
    {text:"'Quick' should be 'quickly' — an adverb is required to modify the verb 'complete.'", isCorrect:true, rationale:"'Complete' is a verb; it must be modified by an adverb ('quickly'), not an adjective ('quick')."},
    {text:"'Soon' should be 'soonly.'", isCorrect:false, rationale:"'Soonly' is not a word."},
    {text:"'Hopes' should be 'hope.'", isCorrect:false, rationale:"'The committee' is singular, so 'hopes' (third-person singular) is correct."},
    {text:"'An announcement' should be 'the announcement.'", isCorrect:false, rationale:"'An' is appropriate for an unspecified announcement — no error."},
