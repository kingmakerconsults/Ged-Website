    passage:
      'The Great Plains were home to numerous Native American nations, including the Lakota Sioux, Cheyenne, Comanche, and Arapaho, whose cultures were centered on the buffalo. Buffalo provided food, clothing, shelter (tipi covers), tools (from bones), and fuel (dried dung). An estimated 30 to 60 million buffalo roamed the Plains before white settlement. By the 1880s, fewer than 1,000 remained. The destruction was driven by commercial hunting (buffalo hides were in great demand), sport hunting from railroad cars, and a deliberate U.S. military strategy to undermine Native resistance by eliminating their primary resource.',

    passage:
      'In 1876, the Battle of Little Bighorn became one of the most famous confrontations between Native Americans and the U.S. Army. Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer led approximately 210 soldiers of the 7th Cavalry against a combined force of Lakota Sioux, Northern Cheyenne, and Arapaho warriors led by Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse. Custer, who had divided his forces and underestimated the size of the Native encampment, was surrounded and his entire command was killed. The victory was a stunning achievement for the Native forces, but it also intensified the U.S. government\u2019s determination to crush Native resistance, leading to increased military campaigns across the Plains.',

    passage:
      'The Dawes Act of 1887 represented a fundamental shift in federal Indian policy from removal and reservations to forced assimilation. The Act divided communal tribal lands into individual allotments of 160 acres per family head (80 acres for single adults), with "surplus" land sold to white settlers. The stated goal was to transform Native Americans into independent farmers and integrate them into American society. In practice, the Act devastated Native communities: tribal landholdings shrank from 138 million acres in 1887 to 48 million acres by 1934. The individual allotments were often on poor land, Native peoples lacked farming equipment, and the destruction of communal land ownership undermined traditional social structures.',

    passage:
      'The Wounded Knee Massacre of December 29, 1890, marked the end of armed Native American resistance on the Great Plains. The 7th Cavalry surrounded a band of approximately 350 Miniconjou Lakota Sioux at Wounded Knee Creek in South Dakota to disarm them. During the process, a shot was fired\u2014the source remains disputed\u2014and soldiers opened fire with rifles and Hotchkiss rapid-fire guns. Between 250 and 300 Lakota men, women, and children were killed, many while attempting to flee. Twenty soldiers also died, mostly from friendly fire. The Army initially classified the event as a "battle," and twenty soldiers received the Medal of Honor, though efforts to rescind those medals have continued into the 21st century.',

    passage:
      'The cattle industry boomed on the Great Plains after the Civil War, creating the iconic era of the American cowboy. Texas longhorn cattle, which had multiplied during the war years, could be purchased cheaply in Texas and driven north along trails like the Chisholm Trail to railroad towns in Kansas, where they sold for ten times their Texas price. The long drives, covering 1,000 miles or more over several months, employed cowboys of diverse backgrounds\u2014historians estimate that roughly one-third were Mexican vaqueros or African Americans. The open-range cattle era was relatively brief, lasting only about twenty years before barbed wire fencing, homesteader farming, and severe winters ended the long drives.',

    passage:
      'Life on the frontier was extremely challenging for settler families. Homesteaders on the Great Plains, where timber was scarce, built houses from blocks of sod cut from the prairie. These "soddies" were durable but plagued by insects, snakes, and leaking roofs. Water was often scarce, requiring wells to be dug by hand. Women on the frontier faced particular hardships: in addition to domestic responsibilities, they often worked alongside men in the fields, managed livestock, and served as the family\u2019s primary medical provider. Isolation was a constant challenge\u2014the nearest neighbor might be miles away, and many settlers lived far from schools, churches, and stores.',

      'Mining communities that sprang up across the West during the gold and silver rushes followed a distinctive pattern. A strike would attract thousands of prospectors almost overnight, creating "boomtowns" with hastily built saloons, general stores, and assay offices. These towns often lacked formal law enforcement, leading to vigilante justice. When the ore was exhausted\u2014sometimes within just a few years\u2014the population would vanish as quickly as it appeared, leaving behind "ghost towns."

Following the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad and an economic downturn in the 1870s, anti-Chinese sentiment intensified among white workers who blamed Chinese immigrants for depressed wages. The Act suspended Chinese immigration for ten years and prohibited Chinese residents from becoming naturalized citizens. It was extended multiple times and not fully repealed until 1943. The law set a precedent for future immigration restrictions based on race and national origin, marking a significant departure from America\u2019s previous policy of relatively open immigration.',
