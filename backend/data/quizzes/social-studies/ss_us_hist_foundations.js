    "content": {
      "passage": "Mercantilism was the dominant economic theory during the Age of Exploration. It held that a nation's wealth was measured by its supply of gold and silver. Colonies were seen as essential to this system, existing to provide raw materials to the mother country and to serve as a market for its manufactured goods. This created a closed economic loop designed to make the mother country rich.",
      "imageURL": "",
      "questionText": "Based on the principles of mercantilism described, which of the following actions would a mother country most likely take?"
    },

      {
        "text": "Encourage its colonies to trade freely with other nations.",
        "rationale": "This contradicts the idea of a closed economic loop designed to benefit only the mother country.",
        "isCorrect": false
      },
      {
        "text": "Import manufactured goods from its colonies.",
        "rationale": "The system dictates that colonies provide raw materials, not manufactured goods.",

      },
      {
        "text": "Impose tariffs and restrictions on goods imported into the colonies from other nations.",
        "rationale": "Correct. This action would protect the mother country's monopoly and ensure the colony remains a dedicated market for its goods.",
        "isCorrect": true
      },
      {
        "text": "Grant its colonies political independence.",
        "rationale": "Political control was necessary to maintain economic control under mercantilism.",
