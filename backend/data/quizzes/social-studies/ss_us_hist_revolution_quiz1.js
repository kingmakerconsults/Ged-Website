    passage:
      'After the French and Indian War ended in 1763, Britain faced enormous war debts. Parliament determined that the American colonies should help pay for the conflict and for the continued cost of maintaining British troops along the frontier. The Stamp Act of 1765 required colonists to purchase special stamped paper for legal documents, newspapers, and playing cards. This was the first direct internal tax levied on the colonies by Parliament, and it provoked widespread outrage not because the amounts were large but because colonists believed Parliament had no right to tax them without their consent.',

        isCorrect: false,
        rationale:

    passage:
      'The Sons of Liberty were a secret organization formed in the American colonies to oppose British taxation policies. Founded in 1765 in response to the Stamp Act, the group organized protests, boycotts of British goods, and sometimes acts of intimidation against tax collectors. In Boston, the Sons of Liberty, led by Samuel Adams, were particularly active. They hanged effigies of the local stamp distributor, ransacked the home of the lieutenant governor, and pressured merchants to join non-importation agreements. Similar groups operated in every colony, creating an intercolonial network of resistance.',

    passage:
      'On March 5, 1770, a confrontation between British soldiers and a crowd of colonists in Boston escalated into violence when soldiers fired into the crowd, killing five men. The first to fall was Crispus Attucks, a man of African and Native American descent who became one of the first casualties of the American independence movement. Colonial leaders like Samuel Adams and Paul Revere used the event\u2014which they labeled the "Boston Massacre"\u2014as propaganda to rally opposition to the British military presence. Revere\u2019s widely circulated engraving depicted the soldiers as aggressive aggressors firing on a peaceful crowd, though the actual circumstances were more ambiguous.',

    passage:
      'The Tea Act of 1773 was not a new tax on tea but rather a measure that gave the British East India Company a monopoly on tea sales in the colonies. By allowing the company to sell directly to colonial retailers and bypass middlemen, the Act actually made British tea cheaper than smuggled Dutch tea. However, colonists recognized the Act as a strategy to make them accept Parliament\u2019s right to tax them. On December 16, 1773, members of the Sons of Liberty disguised as Mohawk Indians boarded three ships in Boston Harbor and dumped 342 chests of tea into the water\u2014an act of protest known as the Boston Tea Party.',

    passage:
      'In response to the Boston Tea Party, Parliament passed a series of punitive measures in 1774 that colonists called the "Intolerable Acts." The Boston Port Act closed Boston\u2019s harbor to all commercial shipping until the destroyed tea was paid for. The Massachusetts Government Act replaced the colony\u2019s elected council with crown-appointed officials and severely limited town meetings. The Administration of Justice Act allowed royal officials accused of crimes to be tried in Britain rather than by colonial juries. The Quartering Act required colonists to house British soldiers in their homes. Rather than isolating Massachusetts, these acts united the colonies in opposition to what they saw as tyrannical overreach.',

    passage:
      'The First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia in September 1774, bringing together delegates from twelve of the thirteen colonies (Georgia did not attend). The Congress adopted the Continental Association, which established a colonial-wide boycott of British imports and banned exports to Britain. Delegates also drafted a Declaration of Rights and Grievances that asserted colonial rights while still professing loyalty to the Crown. The Congress agreed to meet again in May 1775 if their grievances were not addressed. This gathering marked a critical step in colonial cooperation\u2014for the first time, representatives from most colonies acted collectively against British policy.',

Written in plain, accessible language rather than the formal style typical of political discourse, it reached a wide audience\u2014selling an estimated 500,000 copies in a population of approximately 2.5 million. Paine argued that hereditary monarchy was absurd and that an island (Britain) had no right to govern a continent (America).
