    "passage": "After the French and Indian War (1754-1763), Great Britain was left with a significant war debt. To manage this debt, the British Parliament began imposing new taxes on the American colonies. Acts like the Stamp Act (1765) and the Townshend Acts (1767) taxed goods such as paper, glass, and tea. Colonists strongly protested these taxes, arguing that they were a form of 'taxation without representation,' since the colonies had no elected representatives in the British Parliament to voice their interests.",
