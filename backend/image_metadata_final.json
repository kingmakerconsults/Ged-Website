    "extractedText": "Energy Sources\nNonrenewable Energy Sources: Energy resources that cannot be replenished.\nUranium - Nuclear Energy:\n- This is obtained by nuclear fission, which is the process of splitting apart uranium atoms in a controlled manner that creates energy.\n- This is quite dangerous because if the chain reaction of splitting the atoms is not controlled very carefully, an atomic explosion could occur.\n- The fission process gives off heat energy, which is used to boil water in a power plant's reactor core. The steam created with this water is used to turn a turbine, generating electricity.\nFossil Fuel: Coal, oil, and gas are called \"fossil fuels\" because they have been formed from the organic remains of prehistoric plants and animals.\nPetroleum/Oil:\n- Petroleum is made when organic matter settles in water that has lost its dissolved oxygen and is then compressed under immense heat and pressure for millions of years.\n- It is extracted and turned into a variety of fuel sources including petrol or gasoline, diesel, propane, jet fuel, heating oil, and paraffin wax.\n- It is also called crude oil.\nNatural Gas:\n- This is a by-product of decomposition.\n- The most common form of natural gas is methane, created from decays of organic matter.\n- Natural gas burns cleaner than oil or coal, releases less carbon dioxide, causes less pollution, and is environment friendly, which has encouraged its use.\nCoal:\n- It is composed of organic matter that decomposed and then formed into carbon rock under immense pressure.\n- Coal is generally highly combustible and the world's most-used resource for electrical generation.\n- Burning coal releases massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which is the primary factor in the greenhouse effect.\nRenewable Energy Sources: Energy that comes from a source that's constantly renewed or can be replenished naturally in a short period of time.\nSolar:\n- This form of energy relies on the nuclear fusion power from the core of the sun. This energy can be collected and converted in a few different ways. For example, solar water heating with solar panels.\nWind Power:\n- The movement of the atmosphere is driven by differences of temperature at the Earth's surface due to varying temperatures of the Earth's surface when heated by sunlight. For example, wind energy can be used to pump water or generate electricity.\nHydroelectric:\n- This form uses the gravitational potential of elevated water, for example, hydroelectric dams.\nBiomass:\n- It is the term for energy from plants.\n- Energy in this form is very commonly used throughout the world.\n- Unfortunately, the most popular is the burning of trees for cooking and warmth. This process releases copious amounts of carbon dioxide gases into the atmosphere and is a major contributor to air pollution.\n- Some of the more modern forms of biomass energy are methane generation and production of alcohol for automobile fuel and fueling electric power plants.\nHydrogen Fuel Cells:\n- These are not strictly renewable energy resources but are very abundant in availability and are very low in pollution when utilized.\n- Hydrogen can be burned as a fuel, typically in a vehicle, with only water as the combustion product. This clean burning fuel can mean a significant reduction of pollution in cities.\nGeothermal Power:\n- This is obtained from the energy of naturally occurring hot water and steam that is heated underground.\n- This energy can be used to generate electricity. This possibility is limited by geography.",

Japan had no oil resources, and its leadership knew that an oil embargo would have a serious impact on its military combat readiness. The correct answer is Choice (B). Though Japan may have wanted to seize American oil fields (Choice (A)) or develop its own oil resources (Choice (C)), the text doesn't support these answers. (Tip: For more detail on the lead-up to major U.S. historical events, including the wars mentioned here, check out Chapter 9.)\nThe economic fallout of wars is obvious. According to a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) document from 2007, “total spending for U.S. operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and other activities related to the war on terrorism would amount to between $1.2 trillion and $1.7 trillion for fiscal years 2001 through 2017.” Much of this cost is financed by borrowing because successive governments have reduced taxes and increased spending. That means the debt will be around for a long time.
